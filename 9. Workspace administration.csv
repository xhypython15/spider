SAML SSO,"SAML SSOIn this ArticleNotion provides Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality for Business and Enterprise customers to access the app through a single authentication source. This allows IT administrators to better manage team access and keeps information more secure 🔐Jump to FAQsContentsWhat is SAML SSO?Benefits of SSOSetting up SAML SSO for your workspacePrerequisites for SSO with NotionEnable SAML SSO for a single workspaceLink additional workspaces to an existing SAML SSO configurationEnforce SAML SSOJust-in-Time (JIT) ProvisioningIdentity Provider (IdP) SetupEntra IDGoogleOktaOneLoginRipplingCustom SAML SSO configurationSwitching identity providersTroubleshootingNotion’s single sign-on (SSO) services are built upon the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0 standard that permits identity managers to safely pass authorization credentials to service providers like Notion and connect your Identity Provider (IdP) and workspace(s) for an easier, more secure login experience.What is SAML SSO?SSO services permit a user to use one set of credentials (for example, a name or email address and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the end user only once for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session.Note: SAML SSO is available for workspaces on Notion's Business or Enterprise Plans. Contact sales to learn more → Benefits of SSOStreamlines user management across systems for workspace owners.Removes the need for end-users to remember and manage multiple passwords. Simplifies end-users experience by allowing them to sign in at one single access point and enjoy a seamless experience across multiple applications.Note: Only members can access a workspace via SSO. Guests are not supported.Learn more about members and guests in a Notion workspace → Setting up SAML SSO for your workspacePrerequisites for SSO with NotionYour workspace must be on a Business Plan or Enterprise Plan.Your Identity Provider (IdP) must support the SAML 2.0 standard.Only a workspace owner can configure SAML SSO for a Notion workspace.At least one domain has been verified by a workspace owner.Enable SAML SSO for a single workspaceGo to Settings & members, then select the Settings tab.In the Allow email domains section, remove all email domains.Then select the Identity & provisioning tab. Verify one or more domains. See instructions for domain verification here → Toggle on Enable SAML SSO and the SAML SSO Configuration modal will automatically appear and prompt you to complete the set-up.The SAML SSO Configuration modal is divided into two parts:The Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL is to be entered in your Identity Provider (IdP) portalThe Identity Provider Details is a field in which either an IdP URL or IdP metadata XML must be provided to Notion.For more information on where to enter and obtain this information, please refer to our IdP-specific guides below. Note: Guests are not supported with SAML SSO on Notion. Link additional workspaces to an existing SAML SSO configurationNote: Linking additional workspaces to a SAML SSO configuration is only possible for customers on the Enterprise Plan. For more information, contact sales → From the workspace where you have verified your domain and enabled SAML SSO, there is a Linked workspaces section listing all of the workspaces associated with your SAML SSO configuration.  Users with a verified email address who have access to the primary workspace or one of the linked workspaces will be able to log in via SAML SSO.Sales-assisted Enterprise customers can add Enterprise workspaces to their SAML SSO configuration or remove them by reaching out to team@makenotion.com.Enforce SAML SSOOnce you have completed your configuration of SAML SSO for a single workspace, users will be able to log in via SAML SSO in addition to other log-in methods such as username/password and Google Authentication.To ensure users can only log in using SAML SSO and no other method, update the Login method to Only SAML SSO. Once this happens, workspace users will be logged out and required to log back in using SAML SSO. SAML SSO will only be enforced for users who use your verified domain and have access to the primary workspace or a linked workspace.Guests invited to pages in a Notion workspace can’t use SAML SSO to login. Instead, they’ll always use their e-mail and password or log in with Google or Apple.Workspace owners will always have the option to bypass SAML SSO by using their email and password credentials. This is to allow them to access Notion in the event of IdP/SAML failure. They will be able to log in and disable or update their configuration.Just-in-Time (JIT) ProvisioningNotion supports Just-in-Time provisioning when using SAML SSO. This allows someone signing in via SAML SSO to join the workspace automatically as a member.To enable Just-in-Time provisioning:In Settings & members → Identity & provisioning, make sure that Automatic account creation is enabled.Note: We don’t recommend enabling Just-in Time provisioning if you are using SCIM. Having an “allowed email domain” in place allows users on that domain to join the workspace so there could be a mismatch between membership in their Identity Providers and Notion. Identity Provider (IdP) SetupThese are instructions for setting up Notion SAML SSO with Entra ID (formerly Azure), Google, Okta, and OneLogin. If you use a different Identity Provider and need assistance with configuration, please contact our support team.Entra IDFor additional documentation, you can also reference steps on Entra ID's website here:Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) single sign-on (SSO) integration with NotionStep 1: Create a new application integrationSign in to the Entra ID portal.

Make sure the radio button Identity Provider URL is selected.RipplingFor detailed documentation, you can reference Rippling's website here →Custom SAML SSO configurationIf you don't use one of Notion’s supported SAML providers, you can also configure your IdP to use SAML with Notion.Step 1: Set up your IdPYour IdP must support the SAML 2.0 spec to be used with Notion.Configure the ACS URL to the value Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL from Notion. You can find this in Settings → Identity & Provisioning → Edit SAML SSO Configuration.Configure NameID to urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress.Similarly, configure username to urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress.Configure EntityID to https://notion.so/sso/saml. You can find this in Settings → the bottom of Identity & Provisioning.Configure the following attributes:emailAddress: This is a user's email address. Most IdPs set this by default.(Optional) firstName(Optional) lastName(Optional) profilePictureCopy the IdP metadata URL or IdP metadata XML for next steps.Step 2: Set up SAML in NotionIn Notion, click Settings & members →  Settings → Identity & provisioning.Add new email domains and follow the prompts to verify them. These must be email domains of your users logging into Notion.In SAML Single sign-on (SSO) settings, toggle Enable SAML SSO on. This will open the SAML SSO Configuration dialog.Under Identity Provider Details, input the IdP metadata URL or IdP metadata XML from your IdP. Make sure you provide your desired inputs for Login method, Automatic account creation, and Linked workspaces.Switching identity providersTo switch identity providers, go to Settings & members in your left sidebar → Identity & provisioning → Edit SAML SSO configuration. Enter your new information, then select Save changes.When switching to a new IdP, we recommend that:SSO not be enforced during the transition, so you can minimize the risk of locking users out.Email addresses for the users under your new IdP match the user’s email in Notion.Note: Changing identity providers does not end user sessions or deactivate users. TroubleshootingIf you encounter errors when setting up SAML SSO, check to make sure your IdP's metadata, SAML requests and responses are valid XML against the SAML XSD schemas. You can do so using this online tool: https://www.samltool.com/validate_xml.phpNote that we do not support the EntitiesDescriptor element. If your IdP's metadata contains this element, extract the contained EntityDescriptor element and try again.FAQsWhy is the current Enable SAML SSO greyed out?The most common reason is that you have not yet verified ownership of a domain. If this is the case, you will notice that you either don’t have any domains listed in the verify email domain section or the domain is pending verification. For next steps, refer to our instructions on how to complete domain verification here → Why can’t I edit the SAML SSO settings?The most common reason is that you are trying to modify the verified domains or SSO configuration from a linked workspace which is a workspace that is already associated with another SSO configuration.In linked workspaces, all domain management and SSO configuration settings are read-only. To modify the SSO configuration or remove this workspace from the SSO configuration, you must have access to the primary workspace. The name of the primary workspace can be found at the top of the Identity & Provisioning settings tab.Why do I need to verify a domain to enable SSO?We ask that the email domain ownership is validated to ensure that only the owner of the domain can customize how their users log into Notion.Having trouble setting up SSO? Here are some common issues:Try using a URL instead of an XML.We recommend testing the setup process with a test account before enforcing it for users.If neither of these options help, reach out to support at team@makenotion.com.Why should I remove email domains from the “Allowed Email Domains” setting before configuring SAML SSO for my workspace?The “Allowed Email Domain” setting allows users with the selected domains to access your workspace without being provisioned via your IdP. To ensure that only users provisioned via your IdP can access your SAML-enabled workspace, disable this feature by removing all email addresses from the “Allowed Email Domain” list.Can I still log in to Notion if my identity provider is out of service?Yes, even with SAML enforced, Workspace owners have the option to log in with email. Thereafter, a Workspace owner can change the SAML configuration to disable Enforce SAML so users may log in with email again.Are profile photos transmitted to Notion from the IdP?Yes, profilePhoto is an optional custom attribute. You may assign this attribute to a corresponding attribute in your IdP, provided the attribute contains the URL to an image. If the profilePhoto field is set, this image will replace the avatar in Notion when the user signs in using SAML SSO.How do I allow admins of other workspaces in my SAML configuration create new workspaces?Only the admins of your primary workspace will be able to create new workspaces using your verified domain(s). Please reach out to our support team (team@makenotion.com) to switch your primary SAML workspace to another linked workspace in your SAML configuration.Still have more questions? Message support"
Manage your Enterprise workspace,"Manage your Enterprise workspaceIn this ArticleThis one's for administrators of workspaces on the Enterprise Plan! Find out more about your capabilities in Notion 👤ContentsEnterprise admin typesWorkspace ownerMembership adminEnterprise admin typesWorkspaces on the Enterprise Plan have two admin types. Here is an overview of their capabilities within the workspace: Workspace ownerWorkspace owners can manage everything in the workspace from settings to security, members to groups — and even delete an entire workspace. They can also approve or reject requests to invite guests to a workspace.Think of them as the primary administrator of the workspace with the most expansive permissions.Tip: We recommend you choose at least two workspace owners so there is always a backup! Membership adminMembership admins are more limited administrators who can manage user membership. They can:Add or remove members from the workspace.Note: Membership admins can add users to the workspace in a member role only. Membership admins cannot add workspace owners or membership admins to the workspace.Add or remove members, membership admins, and workspace owners from existing groups.Membership admins cannot edit other workspace settings."
Domain management,"Domain managementIn this ArticleThis article will cover how to verify ownership of a domain and which advanced workspace security settings it will unlock for Enterprise customers 🧷Jump to FAQsContentsVerify a domain for your workspaceVerify a domain for an integrationWorkspace creation permissionsCustomize permissions for workspace creation using your domain(s)Enabling Domain ClaimNotification periodView claimable workspacesChange workspace ownershipDelete workspacesRecover workspacesClaim workspacesConsolidate workspacesDomain verification allows Business and Enterprise workspace owners to claim ownership over an email address domain associated with their workspace. This unlocks domain management settings like configuring SAML SSO for your workspace, building Notion integrations using link previews, and controlling who can create workspaces (for Enterprise Plans only).Domain verification does not impact your billing.Verify a domain for your workspaceNote: To do this, you must be a workspace owner on a Business or Enterprise Plan. To verify a domain for your workspace:Go to Settings in your sidebar.Select Identity & provisioning.Next to Verified domains, select Add domain.Enter your new domain and select Next.Follow the prompts to update your DNS record.Click Verify to prompt Notion to check your DNS record.If your domain’s status is Pending, select ••• next to the domain → View details → Verify to manually verify it.Once verification is complete, you’ll receive a confirmation email and your domain’s status will be Verified.Note:Typically, a change in the DNS record takes only minutes to propagate; however, there are cases where it may take up to 72 hours.You must verify a domain within one week of adding the domain. After a week, the verification code will expire and you’ll have to repeat the steps above. Verify a domain for an integrationIf you’re building an integration with Notion, like Link Previews, you’ll need to verify your domain in the integration management page (this action will not take place in Notion).You can find the full instructions in our Developer Guides →Workspace creation permissionsPrerequisites for customizing workspace creation permissionsWorkspace must be on the Enterprise Plan.You must be a workspace owner.You have verified at least one domain. Instructions for domain verification can be found above → Customize permissions for workspace creation using your domain(s)You can customize permissions for who can create new workspaces using your verified domain(s).In Settings & members, go to Identity & provisioning and then Workspace creation.Select Anyone to allow any user with your verified domain to create a new workspace.Select Workspace owners to prevent users with your verified domain from creating new workspaces.Note: The default setting for workspace creation permissions once a domain is verified is workspace owners only. Enabling Domain ClaimOnce a domain is verified, workspace owners on the Enterprise Plan can transfer, delete, or claim ownership over non-Enterprise workspaces created by users with their verified domain.Prerequisites for viewing claimable workspacesYou must be a workspace owner on the Enterprise Plan.Verified domain is a non-educational domain.What workspaces are eligible?Single-member workspaceThe workspace creator’s email belongs to the verified corporate domain.Multi-member workspaceThe workspace creator’s email belongs to the verified corporate domain (the creator does not need to be a current member of the space).At least one current workspace owner (either the creator or someone else) is using the verified corporate email address.Workspace is not on the Enterprise Plan.Notification periodOnce a workspace owner verifies a domain, an automated email will be sent to all workspace owners of workspaces created with that domain, notifying them that their workspaces are eligible to be claimed.During this 14 day notification period, workspace owners can only request ownership transfers on single-member workspaces. They will be unable to delete single-member workspaces or claim multi-member workspaces.After a domain is verified, users who create new workspaces with a verified domain will be notified upon creation that their workspace is eligible to be claimed.View claimable workspacesOnce a domain is verified, Enterprise workspace owners can view all non-enterprise workspaces created by users with their verified domain. This view can be found in your workspace security settings in the Identity & provisioning tab under the Domain management section. For each workspace, this view includes:Workspace namePlan typeNumber of membersWorkspace ownersCreated atCreated byWorkspace owners can take the following actions on their claimable workspaces:Request ownership change on single-member workspaces.Delete single-member workspaces.Claim multi-member workspaces.Export list of claimable workspacesWorkspace owners can also export the list of claimable workspaces as a CSV.Click on Settings & members in your sidebar and go to Identity & provisioning.Click on Browse workspaces and then Export to CSV in the top right.Change workspace ownershipWith domain management, workspace owners on the Enterprise Plan can request a change in ownership transfer on single-member workspaces using a verified domain to a non-corporate email address. This is especially helpful when users created a workspace using a corporate email address, but use the workspace primarily for personal projects.Workspace owners need to initiate the change request in the workspace security settings. In the workspace settings, navigate to the Identity & provisioning tab and Browse workspaces in the Domain management section. From the claimable workspace view, complete the following steps:Select the single-member workspace that you would like to change.In the ••• menu, select Require account change.Provide a contact email for questions from users about the request and confirm the action.In the view, the workspace will enter a Pending state.When the change request is submitted, an email notification will be sent to the workspace owner of the selected workspace and the user will not be able to access their workspace until they have completed the remaining transfer steps as follows:Log into the workspace.Follow the instructions and change email address associated with the account to a non-corporate email address. Note: While a single-member workspace ownership change is requested, the user cannot change the email associated with their user account.A verification code will be sent to the email address to confirm the user’s ownership of the account. Enter this verification code in the workspace.An automated email will be sent once the change is complete.Prerequisites for changing a workspace ownershipYou must be a workspace owner on an Enterprise Plan.The workspace to be changed must be on a single-member.Delete workspacesWith domain management, Enterprise workspace owners can more easily govern how a verified domain is used and where related projects are stored on Notion. When an employee leaves a company, Enterprise workspace owners can delete their single member workspaces to cleanup old content while remaining compliant.Prerequisites for deleting a workspaceYou must be a workspace owner on the Enterprise Plan.The domain was verified at least 14 days ago.Workspace to be deleted must be a single-member workspace that is either free or not delinquent on payments.Note: Single-member workspaces that are deleted by an Enterprise workspace owner using domain management are not eligible for refunds or credits. In the workspace settings, navigate to the Identity & provisioning tab and select Browse workspaces in the Domain management section. From the claimable workspace view, complete the following steps:Select the single-member workspace you would like to deleteClick the ••• menu and select Delete workspaceProvide a contact email for questions from users about the deletion and confirm the actionIn the workspace view, a Recover button will appear next to the selected workspace. When the deletion is initiated, an email notification will be sent to the workspace owner of the selected workspace. The single member workspace owner will immediately lose access to their workspace.Note: Enterprise workspace owner will have 30 days to recover the workspace if needed. After 30 days, the workspace will be permanently deleted automatically. Workspace was deleted by mistake?If you receive an email notification about a workspace that has been deleted accidentally instead of transferred, please reach out to your respective Enterprise workspace owner provided in the email notification directly.Note: Only the Enterprise workspace owner who initiated the deletion can recover deleted workspaces. Notion Support cannot override Enterprise workspace owner actions to restore deleted workspaces.  Recover workspacesTo recover a deleted workspace, the Enterprise workspace owner that initiated the deletion can do this in the workspace settings: navigate to the Identity & provisioning tab and select Browse workspaces in the Domain management section. From the claimable workspace view, complete the following steps:Go to the single-member workspace you would like to recover.Click on the Recover button for the workspace and confirm.In the view the workspace will now appear without the recover button.The owner of the single-member workspace will regain access to their workspace and their workspace content will be restored.The workspace owner of the single-member workspace selected for deletion can request Notion Support extend the recovery timeframe by 30 days from the day they contact Support. After the recovery timeframe expires workspace data will be permanently deleted.When a workspace is recovered, all page content in the workspace will be restored and the single-member workspace owner will regain access.The following content cannot be recovered:FavoritesGuest accessConfigured integrations (Bots)Domains (custom Notion domains)Claim workspacesWith domain management, workspace owners can establish authorized workspaces for employees to collaborate by claiming ownership over eligible multi-member workspaces.Note: If you’re on the Enterprise plan with quarterly true-ups, please work with your dedicated Account Management team to claim workspaces and bring them under your Enterprise License. In the workspace security settings, navigate to the Identity & provisioning tab and Browse workspaces in the Domain management section. From the claimable workspaces view, complete the following steps:Select the multi-member workspace that you would like to claim ownership.Verify payment information (only credit card payments are supported).Review and accept the billing implications of claiming the workspace.When the claim of ownership is processed:Claimed workspace will be upgraded to the Enterprise Plan.Workspace owner that claimed the workspace will become the only workspace owner.Previous workspace owners are downgraded to members (workspace owners can re-assign roles and permissions as necessary).Prerequisites for claiming a workspaceYou must be a workspace owner on the Enterprise Plan.The domain was verified at least 14 days ago.The claimed workspace must be multi-member.The workspace creator’s email belongs to the verified corporate domain (the creator does not need to be a current member of the space).At least one current workspace owner (either the creator or someone else) is using the verified corporate email address.Workspace is not on the Enterprise Plan.Note: Domain claim actions cannot be undone and are captured by the Audit Log. Benefits of claiming a workspaceStandardize billing across Notion workspaces (all workspaces will be invoiced separately).Configure Enterprise workspace security settings to be in compliance with your company policies.Regulate the roles and responsibilities for the workspace (workspace owner, membership admin, member).Consolidate workspacesThe workspace consolidation tool is available to Enterprise customers through their Notion Account Management team. Learn more about workspace consolidation support here.FAQsHow do I know if domain ownership verification is complete?If domain ownership verification is complete, the verified domain will appear in a green color scheme.My domain is displayed in red. What does this mean?If the domain is displayed in red that means that either the domain ownership has already been verified in another workspace or the Notion-provided verification code has expired (it expires after 1 week). To verify the domain, please restart the verification process from the beginning.My domain is displayed in yellow. What does this mean?If the domain is displayed in yellow, that means it’s pending validation. You need to either complete the instructions to update the DNS record or click Verify in the Verification modal.I verified my domain in the past with the help of the Notion Support team. What will my workspace creation permissions be?If you verified your domain before the functionality to customize permissions for workspace creation was supported, your setting will remain as Anyone can create a workspace using your verified domain(s).Why would I want to verify more than one domain?If you own multiple domains – e.g. acme.com and example.com – and you plan to use SAML SSO to manage users from these domains or customize their permissions to create new workspaces, you might want to verify multiple domains.Who is restricted from creating a workspace when the setting is Only Workspace Owners?Users from your verified domain will be restricted from creating new workspaces. Only workspace owners of the workspace where the domains have been verified, will be able to create workspaces.What can workspace owners do with domain management?Domain management features help Workspace owners better control and secure their workspaces. You can configure SAML SSO for your workspace, build Notion integrations using link previews, and control who can create workspaces (for Enterprise plans only).What is visible to workspace owners with domain management?Owners of a domain will be able to see a list of workspaces that were created using the corporate domain, including information such as the list of workspace owners, number of members, and created date. They will not be able to see the content within the workspace. What does it mean when a workspaces is in a pending state?Once a domain claim request has been submitted, the workspace will remain in the pending state in the workspace view until the claim has been processed. Why can’t I claim a single-member workspace? I don’t want to delete it or request an account switch.Consolidating workspaces to your primary workspace is coming soon. In the meantime, you can work with the workspace owner of the single-member workspace to move content in your primary workspace.  Why can’t I delete a multi-member workspace?Deleting a multi-member workspace is not supported in the domain management workspace view, but once you’ve successfully claimed a multi-member workspace you can follow the instructions to permanently delete the workspace as the new, sole workspace owner.Why can’t I claim ownership of a workspace when it’s eligible to be claimed?If your claim request is not getting processed, it’s likely that the workspace you’re trying to claim is either:In a delinquent state on paymentsIn the 14 day waiting period after a domain is newly verifiedCan I merge workspaces?Consolidating workspaces to your primary workspace is coming soon. In the meantime, you can claim workspaces and manually move content to a primary workspace. Can I see all workspaces created by someone from my organization?The workspace view in your domain management settings will only show workspaces that are eligible for domain claim.

If you use another Identity Provider, please let us know.Prerequisites for SCIM with NotionYour workspace must be on an Enterprise Plan.Your Identity Provider (IdP) must support the SAML 2.0 protocol.Only a workspace owner can configure SCIM for a Notion workspace.If you want to use SCIM to modify a user's name or email address, you must have verified ownership over their email domain. Learn more about domain verification → Generate your SCIM API tokenEnterprise Plan workspace owners can generate and view SCIM API tokens by going to Settings & members → Identity & provisioning → SCIM provisioning.To generate a new token, click on the + New token button in the right corner.A unique token is generated for each workspace owner that only they can view.Revoke tokensWhen a workspace owner leaves the workspace or their role is changed, their token will be revoked. When this happens, an automated message will be sent to the remaining workspace owners to notify them to replace the revoked token.In addition, active tokens can be revoked by any of the workspace owners in the workspace. To revoke a token, click the 🗑 alongside the respective token.Replace existing tokensIf a token is revoked, you will need to replace it in any existing integrations.Any SCIM integration and user provisioning relying on the revoked token will be disabled until it is replaced by an active token.Note: To avoid breaking existing integrations, make sure to replace any tokens associated with an admin before de-provisioning them. Suppress invite emailsTo control whether users will receive invitations to workspaces and groups via email when provisioned by SCIM, Enterprise Plan workspaces owners can go to Settings & members → Identity & provisioning → SCIM provisioning → Suppress invite emails from SCIM provisioning.

Step 1: Configure Notion to support provisioning with Azure ADLogin to your Notion Workspace, open the Settings & members → Identity & provisioning tab and scroll down to the SCIM provisioning section.If a token hasn’t already been generated, click + Add token and copy the token. You’ll enter this token as your Secret Token in step 5.5.Notion’s SCIM tenant URL is https://www.notion.so/scim/v2, which you’ll use in step 5.5.Step 2: Add Notion from the Azure AD application galleryFollow instructions for adding an application from the gallery here.The Azure AD provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user/group.If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the following steps to assign users and groups to the application.If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can use a scoping filter as described here.Step 3: Configure automatic user provisioning to NotionSign in to the Azure portal. Select Enterprise Applications, then select All applications.In the applications list, select Notion.Select the Provisioning tab.Set the Provisioning Mode to Automatic.Under the Admin Credentials section, input your Notion Tenant URL and Secret Token. Click Test Connection to ensure Azure AD can connect to Notion. If the connection fails, ensure your Notion account has Admin permissions and try again.Select Save.Under the Mappings section, select Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Notion.Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Notion in the Attribute-Mapping section. Select the Save button to commit any changes.Under the Mappings section, select Synchronize Azure Active Directory Groups to Notion.Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Notion in the Attribute-Mapping section. Select the Save button to commit any changes.To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Notion, change the Provisioning Status to On in the Settings section.Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Notion by choosing the desired values in Scope in the Settings section.When you're ready to provision, click Save.Note: This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in Scope in the Settings section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. GoogleFor additional instructions, you can also reference the documentation in the Google Workspace Admin Help Center:Configure Notion user provisioningNotion’s Google SCIM integration supports the following provisioning features:Create users.Update user attributes (if the user has an email domain belonging to your organization).Deactivate users (this removes users from your Notion workspace(s)).Note: Google’s SCIM integration does not support Group provisioning and de-provisioning. Step 1: Enabling user provisioning in NotionGo to the Settings & members tab, then select the Identity & provisioning tab.Scroll down to the SCIM provisioning section (your available SCIM tokens will be listed).In the SCIM tokens table, either click Copy next to an existing token OR click Add token in the right corner to create a new token.Step 2: Configuring provisioning in GoogleMake sure you’re signed into an administrator account to ensure your user account has the appropriate permissions.Continue the steps shown on Google Workspace Admin Help starting at Set up auto-provisioning for the Notion application.GustoReference Gusto for more detailed help in the setup process:Gusto integrates with NotionStep 1: Click Connect and follow the instructions to verify your account credentialsIn your Notion sidebar, go to Settings & members → Identity & provisioning.Under SCIM provisioning, click Add Token and copy the token.On Gusto, paste the token in the SCIM API key field and enter your Notion account email.Step 2: Match Notion user accounts with your team members in GustoOktaNotion's Okta Integration supports the following provisioning features:Create UsersUpdate User Attributes (if the user has an email domain belonging to your organization)Deactivate Users (this removes users from your Notion workspace)Push GroupsStep 1: Enabling provisioning in NotionGo to Settings & members tab, then select the Identity & provisioning tab.Scroll down to the SAML Single sign-on (SSO) section.Open the Edit SAML SSO configuration buttonClick copy link next to the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL.

Transfer content from a deprovisioned user,"Transfer content from a deprovisioned userIn this ArticleThis article outlines how a workspace owner can transfer content from a member who has been deprovisioned from an Enterprise Plan workspace 📖ContentsWhen can a workspace owner transfer content?Reassign contentRestore a user's content and accessWhen can a workspace owner transfer content?When a user is deleted, deprovisioned, or leaves a workspace, they may leave behind private page content. This feature allows a workspace owner of an Enterprise Plan workspace to transfer this content to another, current user so it is easily recovered.Note: This process applies on a user’s private content after they have left a workspace. Content shared with a current workspace member will not be transferrable. A workspace owner is able to reassign the private content of a user who has recently left the workspace if:The user is not currently part of the workspace (they have been deprovisioned).The user had private pages.The user’s private pages were not already reassigned to another user.The user was part of the workspace fewer than 30 days ago.The workspace is on an Enterprise Plan subscription.Reassign contentVisit your Settings & members and click the Members section.Navigate to the Recently left users tab.For the user who has been deprovisioned (the “recently left user”), select the destination where you would like to send the deprovisioned user’s private pages.You will see a confirmation modal; select Transfer private pages to continue the private page transfer process.All of the deprovisioned user's private pages will appear in the destination user’s sidebar, nested under a new top-level private page.Note: A user who has had all their private pages reassigned will no longer be visible in the Recently left list. Restore a user's content and accessIf a user has left and rejoined a workspace within the last 30 days, workspace owners will be able to restore their private pages, shared pages, group membership, and teamspace membership. To do this, simply add a member back to your workspace and their content and access will be automatically restored once they rejoin."

Managed users,"Managed usersIn this ArticleAs an enterprise workspace owner, you have many ways you can manage the users within your domain, including a dashboard where you can get information and make changes 👥Jump to FAQsContentsManaging user accountsManaged users dashboardEnterprise workspace owners have the ability to manage all the users within their organization. A managed user is any user with an account created with the organization's verified email domain.Note: In order to use this feature, you will need to be:On an Enterprise Plan A workspace owner Workspace has a verified domain  There are many ways in which workspace owners can manage users with their domain. To access these settings, click on Settings & members and navigate to Identity & provisioning.Managing user accountsWorkspace owners can use these settings to apply more granularity to how their managed users work in Notion. Allow users to change account information: Let users change theirpreferred name, email address, and profile photo.External workspace access: Decide whether managed users can join workspaces that aren't owned by your organization.Prevent managed users support access: Control which users can allow Notion support to remote login for troubleshooting. For more information on what Notion support can view, see our terms of service.Session duration: Set how long a user can be logged in before they will be required to re-authenticate. This applies to all devices a user is logged in on.For managed users on the Enterprise Plan, Notion has a default session duration of 180 days. However, workspace owners can customize their session duration from 1 hour to 180 days.Log out all users: Force all users to log out.Reset passwords for all users: Force all users to reset their passwords.Managed users dashboardEnterprise workspace owners have access to a handy dashboard that gives them an overview of all users in their verified domain. In this dashboard, workspace owners can:Search and filter all users using the workspace's verified domainsEdit managed user's profile informationView which external workspaces managed users are a part ofRemove managed users from external workspacesThe dashboard displays user details such as name, email address, a list of workspaces they have access to, last active date, and the state of their 2-step authentication. To access the managed users dashboard:Click on Settings & members and navigate to Identity & provisioning.Under User management, find Managed users dashboard and click View dashboard.From this dashboard, workspace owners can search for users by name, email, or ID. Additionally, they can filter by workspace and 2-step verification method. Note: Suspended users remain as billable seats to whatever workspaces they are a part of. All of their content and comments continue to show as normal, any integrations they set up continue to work, but their profile photo will appear as a gray crossed out silhouette. On a specific user's profile, workspace owners can:Suspend the userDelete the userChange the user's name and email address. The new email must belong to the verified domain.Log the user outReset the user's passwordRemove the user from external workspacesFAQsWill changes to managed user accounts made by the workspace admins be tracked?Yes, all changes made by a workspace owner to a managed user’s account will be logged in the audit log. If a password is reset or a user is removed from a workspace, they will receive an email notification.Will users in my workspace know that their account is being managed by the workspace admin?Yes, users will see a badge in their My account settings.If my workspace is using SCIM, can I still make changes to managed user accounts through Notion?Updating managed user profile information from this new dashboard is not recommended if the Enterprise workspace is using the SCIM API directly or through an Identity Provider (e.g. Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace) to programmatically manage workspace members.If the workspace is using SCIM, then changes made from the Notion Settings UI will be replaced when the next SCIM API request syncs up.My workspace has verified several domains. Will I see all managed users for all of our domains together in the dashboard?Yes, you will see all your managed users (from multiple verified domains) together in the dashboard.What happens if a user is suspended?Suspended users remain as billable seats to whatever workspaces they are a part of. All of their content and comments continue to show as normal, any integrations they set up continue to work, but their profile photo will appear as a gray crossed out silhouette. Other users can still share pages with the suspended user, @-mention them, and add them to workspaces or teamspaces. The suspended users won’t be able login, receive any notifications, or access any of these resources. They’ll see them if/when they’re unsuspended.What happens if a user is deleted?All public or shared content created by the deleted user remains, but attributions and @-mentions change to Deleted User. Any private or shared pages where no remaining users have full access will be deleted. Deletions are permanent, with a 30-day grace period to cancel and restore. If the account may be needed in the future, it is recommended to suspend instead of delete. Deleted users do not contribute to the billable seat count of the workspace. Still have more questions?

Deploy Notion for macOS,"Deploy Notion for macOSIn this ArticleLearn how to install and update Notion for your organization 🚀ContentsInstalling Notion on shared machinesDistribute NotionDisable automatic updatesAllow users to update NotionNotion's desktop app provides IT administrators with enhanced control over installations and updates. You have the flexibility to select the installation path for Notion and manage update settings. By default, the Notion app is set up in the /Applications folder on your employees’ machines and is configured to update automatically with each new release.Note: Regular updates are crucial for access to the latest features and ensuring the highest level of security, especially if automatic updates are turned off. Installing Notion on shared machinesNotion allows for use on shared machines by multiple users. It can be installed in either the /Applications or ~/Applications folder of a user's machine. The best installation method depends on your organization's specific needs./ApplicationsAll users on the machine use the same installation of Notion.Updates made to Notion apply to all users on the machine.Users must be administrators to update Notion.~/ApplicationsEach user on a shared machine has their own installation of Notion.Updates made to one instance of Notion do not affect other instances of Notion for other users on the same machine.Users do not need to be administrators to update Notion.Distribute NotionAfter deciding on the installation method, download the appropriate Notion desktop app build. There are three builds available: Intel (x64), Apple Silicon (arm64), and Universal (x64 or arm64). Ensure you distribute the correct build to match your employees' machine types.Note: The Universal build works on Intel and Apple Silicon machines. Keep in mind the installation file is much larger than the other builds. Disable automatic updatesNotion allows you to disable automatic updates for individual users. This feature is useful for when you want to test new Notion app versions before a widespread rollout, or if you prefer to stagger the update process. To keep the app working smoothly and securely, we advise updating Notion with each new version release.To prevent Notion from automatically checking for updates, run the following terminal command as each user who will be running Notion:defaults write notion.id NotionNoAutoUpdates -bool YESUse the following command to re-enable automatic updates:defaults write notion.id NotionNoAutoUpdates -bool NOAllow users to update NotionIf Notion is installed in the ~/Applications folder, users can update the app independently without needing special permissions. However, if the app is installed in the /Applications folder, update permissions are required. Users must be machine administrators and have write access to /Applications, notion.app, and all its subfiles.For shared machines, we recommend setting up a permissions group for all Notion users and installing Notion in a subfolder of /Applications. You can grant this group ownership and write access to the subfolder using the terminal command below.
