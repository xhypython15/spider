As the GDPR is widely considered to be the most stringent global privacy standard, we have mapped our privacy program to the GDPR and other global privacy regulations.Notion as Processor and ControllerThe GDPR and other data protection legislation have two primary classifications related to the collection and processing of personal data: data controller and data processor.A data controller determines the means and purposes for processing personal data, while a data processor is a party that processes data on behalf of the data controller.Where our customer is a data controller or data processor, Notion is the data processor of personal data that our customer and their users upload to the Notion service. We process any such personal data at our customer’s direction and on our customer’s behalf. We conduct this processing in accordance with Notion’s Data Processing Addendum.Cross Border Transfers - Standard Contractual ClausesWe understand and adhere to the rules for international transfers of personal data outside of the European Economic Area and UK. In order for our customers to be confident of Notion’s data transfer processes our Data Processing Addendum incorporates both the EU and UK Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). In response to the Schrems II ruling, our DPA lists the technical and organisational measures we employ to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place when we transfer personal data to countries outside of the EEA and UK.  For more information about our technical security measures, please see our security page.Transfer Impact AssessmentNotion understands and appreciates the importance of maintaining transfer impact assessments (TIA) as a supplementary measure and as a critical piece of your privacy compliance program.

All of these companies have been carefully vetted for best-in-class security and data privacy practices. For more information, please see our list of subprocessors.Data GovernanceData governance relates to the policies and procedures that dictate how data is procured and used throughout its life cycle. From creation and collection to processing, distribution, storage and deletion. Notion’s commitment to data governance is key to keeping our users data secure, private, accurate, and accessible.Privacy by DesignAt Notion, we believe in privacy by design, which means that privacy considerations are built into every aspect of our products and services from the outset. This includes the development of new products, features, and the selection of vendors.Notion conducts regular training with our personnel to reinforce the concept that Notion needs to think of user privacy at all stages of the development lifecycle.Data ExportCompanies generally have a duty to back up their information in multiple places. To help with this Notion offers the option to save any Notion page, database, and non-database page to your computer in various formats. This way our customers can further protect themselves by backing up their information at any time.Data ImportNotion’s data import function lets you upload information from external sources and combine it with the data already held in your workspace. Like most people, you probably have data, documents, and notes scattered across many files and apps. You can centralize your information in one place by moving it all into Notion.Data DeletionThe workspace owner controls the workspace’s Customer Data. This includes all of the content submitted by customers and their users. When users leave a workspace, they may have the right to request that their data is deleted by the workspace owner.
