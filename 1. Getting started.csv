But Notion pages can contain a lot more than plain text!Imagine every piece of content you add to a page — whether it's text, an image, or a table — as a single building block. Every page is a stack of blocks combined however you want.Here's just one example page with different block types pointed out: Tip: Hit the / key on your keyboard (or tap the + button above your keyboard if you're on mobile) to see all the different types of content you can add.

What is a database?,"What is a database?In this ArticleDatabases are a core feature in Notion that help you manage and organize your pages. Let's explain what they are and how they can help you level up your workspace 🗄ContentsDatabases are collections of pagesDatabases are pages themselvesDatabases have propertiesDatabase views display the same content in different waysDatabases are collections of pagesThink of Notion databases as filing cabinets or notebooks. Each database serves as a container, letting you easily organize multiple Notion pages in a single structure. In the screenshot below, every row of the table is a page within the database ""Docs."" This gives you a birds' eye view of an entire collection of pages at once. When you need to dive deeper, each page in a database can be opened, revealing its detailed contents. Databases are pages themselvesBut wait - each database is also a page itself! This is powerful, because it allows you to move and nest databases alongside other content, just like any other page. Databases have propertiesTo help you organize all of the pages within a database, properties can be added to contextualize, label, and augment each individual item.You can then search, filter, and sort by these property values. Database views display the same content in different waysDatabases in Notion are not static. The set of pages within each database can be displayed in many different forms, or what we call views.In addition to table view, the contents of a database can be visualized as a list, board, calendar, gallery, or timeline - whatever makes the information the most useful.

Create a database,"Create a databaseIn this ArticleNow we'll create a database and use it to show off essential database actions and features. You'll get to play with database properties, views, filters, and sorts - let's get into it 📈ContentsCreate a new tableAdd data to your tableOpen a row as a pageCreate new database viewsFilter and sort your dataCreate a new tableAdd a new page and under Get started with and select Table.The first column is where you enter the name of your database pages. Each column in a Notion table corresponds to a property that gives your item context.Click a property heading, then Edit property and Type to see all of your property choices. Add data to your tableFor this example, we'll create a task database.Add some tasks you're working on in the Name column.Now add some values to the Tags column using the multi-select property. The options could be something like P1, P2, and P3 to indicate the priority of a task. Add a new property using the + button to the right of the Tags heading.Change its name to Due Date. Click the property heading, then Edit property and Type and select Date. Now when you click on a cell under Due Date, you'll see the date picker.  Open a row as a pageEvery item in a Notion database is also a whole page of its own! You can add any content you want inside, including other databases.To open a row as a page, hover over a cell in the Name column and click OPEN.You can add or edit any properties. You can also add additional content into the body of the page. Create new database viewsYou can create different views of the same data. Put it into a board, a calendar, a list, a gallery, or a timeline — depending on your needs. Let's try one.Click + at the top of your table. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and select Add view.Give your new view a name and choose Board from the right-side menu.This displays rows from your table into cards on a board, grouped by tag. Clicking on a card still opens it as a page. It's all the same content, just visualized in a different way!Learn more about views here → Tip: Different views are good for different things, and you can have as many as you need!Gallery view is great if you're storing images in your database. Lists are helpful for minimalist storage of documentation. Calendar view displays your pages by an assigned date property.Timelines are useful for visualizing project dates and length.  Filter and sort your dataFilter by property to focus on specific parts of your database.Click the filter icon at the top of your table, then select one of the default options or + Add advanced filter.Then select the criteria that needs to be met. The middle dropdown will give you different options depending on the property.In this case, let's choose Tags as the property, and say it must contain P1. Add sorts to reorder your database depending on property values. Sorts are helpful for quickly ordering your data by priority, date, tags, etc.Click ⇅ at the top of your table, then select the property you'd like to sort by.For example, choose Due Date and then Ascending. This reorders tasks from closest to furthest due date. You'll see your database change in real time based on your filter and sort criteria. You can add as many filters and sorts as you want, and each view has its own filter and sorts."
