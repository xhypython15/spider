See below for some common scenarios.Be mindful of who you add to your workspace and what kind of role they have. Visit this article and our pricing page to understand how we bill you depending on the users in your workspace and the plan you're on. Note: The billing policies described in this article may not apply to sales-assisted customers. Please reach out to your account team for more information. Notion billing basicsYou're billed per memberNotion uses a billing model that charges you based on the number of seats, or licenses, you are using in your workspace. One seat is assigned to each member (not guest) in your workspace. This billing model gives you the flexibility to change which specific people join your Notion workspace as a member, without accruing new charges every time you add a new user.Here’s an example:Your team is working with three contractors, who have been added as members to your Notion instance. When their contracts are finished, you remove them from your Notion workspace.Until the end of your billing period (monthly or annual), you will still have three paid seats in Notion that you can instead fill with new contractors, new hires, interns, or anyone else who you might want to add to your workspace as a member.Learn more about workspace members and how to manage them here → When you add members to your workspace:Regardless of whether you're paying yearly or monthly, our system reviews how many members you've added and issues invoices on a monthly basis.You only pay for the fraction of the billing interval that a member belonged to your workspace.Because you pay at the beginning of every billing interval, these charges for changes made in the middle of a billing interval are added retroactively to your next invoice.On a monthly plan, this means you get your regular monthly invoice billing you for the month ahead (including new members), but the invoice will also include retroactive prorated charges for the members you added during your last billing interval. On a yearly plan, this means you'll receive an invoice at the next month mark (on the same calendar date you bought your plan) that will include two things:The amount due for each new member for the remainder of your year-long plan.Retroactive charges for those new members prorated based on the amount of time they've belonged to your workspace. When you remove members from your workspace:After removing members, you will still have access to any existing paid seats until the end of your billing interval. You can add new members to fill these seats at no additional charge.When your billing interval ends, we will recalculate the total number of paid seats in use in your workspace and bill you accordingly.  Go to Settings in your sidebar → People to view how many paid seats your workspace has, how many members are currently in your workspace, and when you'll be billed next. You can easily manage the members in your workspace here. We bill you upfrontYou always pay for Notion at the start of your billing interval. If you make changes in the middle of a billing interval, we'll prorate how much you're charged, so that you only pay for what you actually used. These prorations will be applied at the start of the next billing interval.Every workspace is billed separatelyYou can create multiple workspaces per account (in other words, per email address you signed up with), in which case you'd receive multiple bills. This is why you might see multiple charges for Notion even if you have only one account.If you have multiple workspaces, you'll be billed based on how many members you have in each (on a Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan). Even if the same people are in multiple workspaces, you'll be charged for them in each one.Your billing interval is set at the workspace levelYou could have one workspace billed annually and one billed monthly. You pay less when you choose annual billing. Everyone who joins your workspace will add an additional charge based on the interval of that workspace.Yearly vs. monthly billingYou can choose to pay for Notion on a yearly or monthly basis. This impacts both how much you pay and when you pay.Yearly billing costs less.Your plan renews automatically either once a year or once a month. If you pay yearly, your plan will renew on the same calendar day you first purchased it for all following years.If you pay monthly, the same is true of each following month.For example, a yearly plan bought on May 3 will renew May 3 the next year, and a monthly plan renews June 3.Your bill adjusts for your paid seat count either once a year or once a month.If you pay yearly, the number of licenses you are paying for will be recalculated and reflected in your billing once a year, on the same calendar date as when you first purchased Notion.This is the only time during the year when your billing will change to reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.If you pay monthly, this recalculation will occur once a month on the same calendar date. Your billing will reflect any paid seats that have been removed from your workspace.When your plan renews, you will only be billed for the number of members currently in the workspace. This means your bill will go down if you have removed members since your last bill, and it will go up if you have added members since your last bill.If you expect your team size to fluctuate often, or you’d like more control over your budget, we recommend a monthly billing interval. See your plan and billing detailsNote: Only workspace owners can view and manage plans and billing. To view the details of your plan and your billing information:Go to Settings in your sidebar.Click Billing in the sidebar of the pop-up window.At the top, you'll see which plan you're on, how much you're paying for it either yearly or monthly, and the date it will renew.Changing your billing intervalTo change your billing interval:Go to Settings in your sidebar.Click Billing in the sidebar of the window that pops up.Click Update next to your current billing interval and choose what you want.Change from monthly to yearlyWhen you change from monthly to yearly, you'll establish a new billing cycle, with your plan automatically renewing on the calendar day you made this change the next year.Whatever amount of time is left on your already paid monthly cycle will be subtracted from your annual payment.For example:Let's say you’re on the Plus Plan, billed monthly.By April 15, you love Notion so much that you switch to a yearly billing interval.You already paid for part of the month, so we prorate the price of your yearly plan.Since half the month went by, we remove the unused time (the latter half of the month) from your yearly price.Change from yearly to monthlyWhen you change from yearly to monthly, the new monthly billing cycle will take effect the day your annual cycle ends. Your plan will automatically renew each month on the same calendar day going forward.View your upcoming invoiceTo view your upcoming invoice:Go to Settings in your sidebar.Select Billing.Under Invoices, select View invoice.Understanding your invoiceYour invoice might look different from what you expect, and this could be for several reasons:You've added or subtracted members from your workspace during the billing interval. Note that when you add new members to your yearly Plus, Business, or Enterprise Plan, you'll be charged for an entire year of Notion for each of them.You changed your billing interval from monthly to yearly, or vice versa.You upgraded your plan during a billing interval. In this case, we charge you your previous rate for the time you had that plan, and your new rate for the time you had your upgraded plan. It's a blend of both!You've applied credits to your balance due.Payment methodsOn Notion for web, you can pay for your plan with a debit or credit card, or Apple Pay. If you're in Europe, we also accept payment through SEPA direct debit (not credit transfer). You can also use Stripe Link to pay with a saved card or save your card for future use on any Stripe checkout. Notion uses Stripe to process payments.On an iOS device, you can pay with Apple Pay. Unfortunately, you can't make payments in the Android app at this time.If you pay with debit or credit card, you're charged upfront for the month or year you're about to spend on Notion. If you pay with SEPA direct debit, you’ll receive a debit notification email. If you have been approved to pay via ACH or bank transfer, you'll receive an emailed invoice on the first day of your billing interval.Note: All valid billing credits will expire six months from the date they are generated. Once credits have expired, they can’t be reinstated. Update your payment method & billing informationGo to Settings in your sidebar.Click Billing in the sidebar of the window that pops up.Click Edit method next to your payment method.Enter the information for your payment method.When you’re done, click Update.SEPAIf you’re using SEPA for the first time to pay for your Notion plan, note that payment must fully process before you can make any changes to your plan, add or remove AI, or update your payment method. We also won’t be able to assist with refunds while your payment is processing.You can, however, add or remove members from your workspace during this time. These changes will be reflected in your next invoice.RefundsOur refund policy is simple. If you believe you've made a mistake signing up for a paid Notion subscription online or in-app, please contact us inside the app or email team@makenotion.com. We'll be happy to refund you the full amount if you downgrade your subscription within 72 hours of signing up for monthly billing, or within 30 days of signing up for annual billing.If you were invoiced for members accidentally added to your workspace, we're happy to provide a refund of the prorated charges if you reach out within 72 hours of the invoice date.

What happened?You may have an unpaid invoice on your account — our system will automatically downgrade a paid account after several attempts are made to collect payment.That said, you can re-upgrade via the Upgrade tab in Settings and settle your unpaid invoices from there. Send us a message if you need help!I just upgraded to a paid plan, but one of my workspaces still says it's on a free plan.Plans only apply to a single workspace and don't cover your whole account. We recommend using the fewest workspaces possible, and taking advantage of top-level pages in your sidebar to stay organized. More on that here.How can I avoid needing multiple workspaces?We've seen people create multiple workspace instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, their executive team, etc. so they can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. You don't need to do this. Instead:Disable Workspace Access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.On every page, grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top-level page for that team, turn on Full Access for only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!How can I update my invoices to include my billing address and/or VAT number?We can update this info for you!
