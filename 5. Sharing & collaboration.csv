Below is an overview of all the ways to share.Share menuSelect Share at the top of any page to open its share menu. Here, you can:Invite someone to the page.See and change who has access to the page, and what level of permissions they have.Copy the page’s link to share it with others. Select ••• at the top of any page, then open the Publish tab to share your page to the web as a Notion Site and manage it. Share with everyone in your workspaceYour workspace might contain other members like teammates, friends, or anyone else you want to work with on pages. There are a few ways to share Notion pages with all members of your workspace:Hover over the name of a default teamspace in your sidebar and create a new page inside of that teamspace by clicking the + that appears.In your sidebar, drag a page into a default teamspace.Select Share at the top of a page and in the dropdown at the bottom of the menu, select Everyone at {your workspace}.Note: A default teamspace is a teamspace that everyone in a workspace must be a part of by default. To find out if a given teamspace is a default teamspace:Select ••• next to the name of a teamspace in your sidebar.Select Teamspace settings.In the Members tab, look for Permissions. If you see Default, this means that teamspace is a default teamspace. Share with a teamspaceTeamspaces are dedicated spaces for every team within your organization or company. Each teamspace has its own members and permission levels, which can be customized by its teamspace owners.

To share a page with specific people:Select Share at the top of any page.Find and select the names of the members/groups in your workspace that you want to share the page with.Open the dropdown next to the names of the people you’re inviting, then select a permission level.Select Invite.Pages shared with select workspace members will appear in the Shared section of your sidebar. Learn more about sidebar sections here → Share with guestsYou can invite people from outside your workspace to access certain Notion pages as guests. This could be useful if you want to share a Notion page with a contractor you've hired, or a client you’re working with. Learn more about guests here →To share a page with a guest:Select Share at the top of the page.Enter the email address of any guest you want to invite.Select a level of access for that guest from the dropdown and select Invite.Your invited guest will receive an email with a link to the page.If they don't already use Notion, they can sign up to access your page.Note:If you’re on an Enterprise plan and the owner has prevented members from inviting guests to pages, then any people you invite to a page will automatically be added as members. Before you select Invite in the steps above, you can hover over your guest’s name or email for more information on how that person will be added to the page.If you’re not able to share a page with a guest, this might be because: Your workspace has reached its guest limit.Your workspace or teamspace has prevented guests from being added to the page.The email domain of the guest you’re trying to share the page with is not an allowed email domain for your workspace. View a list of all guests and the pages they have access to under the ""guests"" tab. Share to the webYou can easily turn your Notion page into a beautiful website with Notion Sites. Learn more about how to share your page with the web here →Stop sharingSeeing other people in a page you didn't mean to share? Want to make a page private? There are a few ways you can stop sharing your pages with others:In your sidebar, drag a page into your Private section so that only you can see it.Select Share at the top of the page, and switch off access for your workspace, individuals, groups, or the public. You can also select Remove from the dropdown next to any of these.To remove guests from pages, click Share on the top of the page and find the guest's name. Click Remove. Permission levelsFor every person, group, or teamspace you share a page with, you can assign a different permission level. This helps to keep private information private and gives you granular, precise control over your work.Here are the different permission levels in Notion:Full access: People with full access to a page can edit any of the content it contains and share the page with anyone they want.Can edit: Select this level of access for people who should be able to edit the content on the page, but not share the page with others.Can edit content: This permission level is only found on database pages. People with this level of access can create and edit pages within the database, and edit property values for those pages. However, they will not be able to change the structure of the database and its properties, views, sorts, or filters. Learn more about databases here →Can comment: Select this level of access for people who should only have the ability to comment on a page. They won’t be able to edit or share the content.Can view: People with this level of access can read the content on the page, but they won’t be able to comment, edit, or share.There are also different actions that people can take in a workspace depending on their role in the workspace. To learn more, read this article →Edit permission levelsNote: If someone has requested a change in their permissions on a page you own, you’ll be able to see, approve, and reject those requests from your Inbox. To change someone’s permission level for a specific page:Select Share at the top of the page.Open the dropdown next to the name of a person, group, or teamspace with whom the page has been shared.Select a permission level. Inherited permissionsWhen you create a subpage inside of a page, that subpage will take on the permissions of its parent page. To change this, go into a subpage and update the permissions there.Teamspace owners can set default permissions for content in their teamspace. This will apply to every new page created in the teamspace, and if you want to change them, you’ll have to make changes at the page level.Permission overridesNotion respects the broadest level of access given to a user. For example, let's say you give Member A Can view permissions to a page. Then you give everyone in your workspace Full access, Member A will also get full access because they are member in your workspace.Additionally, moving a shared page to the Private section of your sidebar will remove everyone else's access on that page. Note: This override will only apply to the parent page — the permissions granted for any subpages will remain the same.If a page is set to be accessible to Anyone with link, note that even those that don’t have the direct link may be able to access in certain cases including the following:The page is mentioned in or linked from another page shared more broadly.The page uses a two-way relation that links to another page shared more broadly.The page is nested inside another page that has been shared more broadly.See who's sharing a pageYou can tell who else has access to a page because their profile photos can be seen in the bar at the very top of the page.An avatar appears faded out if that person is not currently looking at the page.An avatar appears unfaded if the person is currently on the page.Hovering over an avatar will show you the person's name, email, and when they were last on the page.Clicking on an active avatar will jump you to the part of the page where they're reading or typing.When people are collaborating on the same page at the same time, you'll see their avatars move next to the blocks they are looking at or editing.Click ••• at the top right of any page and look at the bottom of the menu that pops up. You'll see who last edited the page and when.Request accessRequest access to a pageIf you open a page that you don’t have access to, you can select No access on the page to send a request. This will notify the page’s creators or editors, who can choose to accept or deny your access request.Request edit accessIf you have view or comment access to a page and want edit access:Open the page and select Share.In the Share tab, you’ll see what level of permissions you currently have. Open the dropdown next to this information.Select Request edit access.This request will go to the page creator, who can accept or ignore it. You’ll be notified once your request has been accepted — try refreshing the page if you’re not able to edit it.Enterprise security settingsIf you’re a workspace owner on an Enterprise Plan, you can control content sharing with additional security settings. Learn more about these features here →To see these settings, go to Settings & members in your sidebar, then select Security & data. FAQsI tried adding a guest to my workspace but they were turned into a member automatically. How can I prevent that?If your workspace is above the guest limit for your plan, new users that you share content with will be automatically added as a member (instead of as a guest) if they have the same organization email domain. To allow for a new user with the same organization email domain to be added as a guest, you will need to remove existing guests to fall below your plan limit, upgrade to a plan with a higher limit, or work with our sales team (for eligible customers).If your workspace is above the guest limit for your plan, you may have the Allowed Email Domains setting turned on. When enabled, this feature allows people with that email domain to join your workspace as a member automatically. You can disable this setting in the Settings tab of Settings & Members in the left sidebar.I want to share a page with a client, but they don't use Notion.You can enable Share to the web in the Share menu, and share the URL with them. As long as you keep the Search engine indexing setting disabled (always disabled by default), only people with that exact URL will be able to access the page. They'll be able to view the page, even if they don't have a Notion account. However, they won't be able to make any edits, leave comments, or sort/filter a database.My Export button is missing, it doesn't appear in any menus.You may have the Disable Export setting enabled in the Settings tab of Settings & Members in your left sidebar. You'll need to be an admin in your workspace, and on desktop to change this.Can I limit access to different parts of a database? Can you make it so that some people can see certain database views or properties, but not others?Unfortunately, database permissions don't get quite that granular yet 😓 It’s a legit use case though, and definitely something we want to support in the future.

Thanks for your understanding! Learn moreNotion pricingBilling, payment, and refunds Who’s who in a workspaceThere are several ways users can interact with a Notion workspace:Members: People in your company or organization who can create and edit Notion pages, but can’t change any settings. These are colleagues or people who you work with across a large portion of your workspace.Guests: People external to your company or organization who can be invited to individual Notion pages, but not an entire workspace. These are people who aren’t part of your team that you may want to work on specific pages with.Workspace owners: Admins who can manage workspace settings, delete a workspace, and manage other workspace owners, admins, members, and guests.Membership admins (Enterprise Plan only): People who can add or remove members from workspaces or groups. They don’t have access to workspace settings. Note: Depending on how your workspace owner has adjusted your workspace’s security settings, members may or may not by able to request adding guests or members. Additionally, users may or may not be able to request to be added to a workspace as a member. MembersMembers are individuals in your company or organization. These could be colleagues at the same organization or people who read, edit, and comment on a lot of the same pages in a workspace.To manage your workspace members, go to Settings → People or Members (depending on your plan). Here, you’ll see:A list of active members of your workspace.What teamspaces and groups they belong to.Each member’s role in the workspace.Add a memberNote: On paid plans, you'll be charged per member in your workspace. For more information on plans, go here → With emailGo to Settings → People or Members (depending on your plan).Go to the Members tab.Select Add members and type the email address of the person you want to add. If you don't have invite access, you will instead have the option to request to add a member.Select whether to add them as a Workspace owner, Membership admin, or Member from the dropdown, then press Invite.They'll receive an email with a link to sign in and join your workspace.Using a linkGo to Settings → People or Members (depending on your plan).Go to the Members tab.Select Copy link to copy the secret link to your clipboard, and share with anyone you’d like to invite to work with you.When an invited user clicks on the secret link, they'll be able to join your workspace automatically as a paid member, without you having to add their email address manually.If you don’t want to be able to invite people to your workspace with a link, turn off the toggle next to Invite link. Change a member's roleGo to Settings → People or Members (depending on your plan).Go to the Members tab.Select the dropdown for a member’s role, then select Workspace owner, Membership admin, or Member. Remove a memberGo to Settings → People or Members (depending on your plan).Go to the Members tab.Depending on your plan: Select the dropdown for a member’s role, then select Remove from workspace.Select ••• next to a member, then select Remove from workspace. Workspace owners can also remove other workspace owners from the workspace.Note:When you remove a member from a workspace, that person will instantly lose access to the workspace, and pages from the Private section of their left sidebar will be hidden from view. If you invite that member back to the workspace, their private pages will be unhidden.If a user has left and rejoined a workspace within the last 30 days, their private pages, shared pages, group membership, and teamspace membership will be restored upon rejoining the workspace. Allowed domains & auto-joiningIf you're using Notion at your company, you can make it easy for anyone to automatically join your workspace as a member when they sign in with their work email.Go to Settings → Settings.Under Allowed email domains, enter any email domain that you want to grant access to automatically, like your company's email domain. You can add multiple allowed domains in this field, but you'll only be able to add domains that workspace members' accounts are under.Now, whenever someone signs into Notion with an email that has one of those domains, they'll see the option to join your workspace during onboarding. If the user joins your workspace, they will become a member of your workspace and you will be billed accordingly.GuestsNote: Unlike members, guests are free to invite to your workspace as long as you stay within your plan’s guest limit. If your workspace is above this limit, any new users that you share content with will be automatically added as members and not guests if they have the same organization email domain.To ensure you’re adding users as guests and not members, you’ll need to remove existing guests so you’re below your limit, upgrade to a plan with a higher limit, or work with our sales team (for eligible customers). Guests are individuals external to your company or organization who you invite into your workspace on a page-by-page basis. For example, guests could be:People who have a different organization email domain.Contractors or interns who are working with you temporarily.Clients who you want to provide feedback on your work.Friends, family, or mentors that you want to have contribute to or review your work.Guests have the same capabilities as members, except:They can't be given workspace-wide access. They must be invited to individual pages in order to view them and their sub-pages.They can't create new pages outside of the ones they have access to.They can't be added to groups of members.They can't adjust workspace settings or billing information.They can't add new members to your workspace.They can't add new integrations to your workspace.Add a guestOn any page you want to share with a guest:Go to Share at the top right.Enter the email address of any guest you want to invite.Select a level of access for that guest from the dropdown and press Invite.Select Skip for now to make sure you’re adding them as a guest and not a member.They'll receive an email with a link to the page.If they don't already use Notion, they can sign up to access your page.Note:If you’re on an Enterprise plan and the owner has prevented members from inviting guests to pages, then any people you invite to a page will automatically be added as members. Before you select Invite in the steps above, you can hover over your guest’s name or email for more information on how that person will be added to the page.If you’re not able to share a page with a guest, this might be because: Your workspace has reached its guest limit.Your workspace or teamspace has prevented guests from being added to the page.The email domain of the guest you’re trying to share the page with is not an allowed email domain for your workspace. Allow and approve access requests from guestsTo make it easier for you to add guests to your workspace, Notion also allows people outside of your workspace to request access to certain pages in your workspace. This feature is available and turned on by default for all plans except Enterprise.If you’re on a Personal Pro, Plus, or Business Plan, you can turn this setting off. Unfortunately, Free plans will not be able to turn this feature off. To do this:Open Settings → Security.Toggle off Allow page access requests from non-members.Once the guest submits a request to access a page, a notification will be sent to the inbox of the page’s creator. The page creator can approve the request as well as adjust the level of access for that guest, or they can ignore the request.Note: When you add someone to a page, they can automatically access all of its sub-pages by default. That being said, you can restrict or expand sub-page permissions! Request adding guestsMembers of a workspace can request to add guests to it. This feature is available on Enterprise Plans only, and only workspace owners can enable or disable it.Enable guest requestsGo to Settings → Security.Make sure Disable members inviting guests to pages is turned on, then turn on Allow members to request adding guests. Workspace owners can Disable guests without removing existing guests from the workspace. They still have the option to remove all existing guests if desired.Once this is turned on, members will have to submit a request before they can invite a guest. Workspace owners are exempt and can continue to invite guests directly.Note: Allow members to request adding guests is a workspace level setting, and will override the any teamspace level guest setting. This means if a teamspace allows guests, but the workspace has enabled guest requests, members will have to submit guest invite requests to add guests to pages in the teamspace. Request to invite a guestIf you're a workspace owner, you can invite guests directly.If you're a member:Navigate to the page you want to invite a guest to. Just like with regular sharing, you must have full access permissions on the page to request to invite a guest.Select Share and type the name of the guest you want to invite.Select the role you want the guest to have.Select Invite.A notification will be sent to your workspace owner about your request, along with the page, role and email of the guest you requested. You will also receive confirmation that your workspace owner has been notified.Approve a guestGuest invite requests must be approved on a per page, per guest basis. Only workspace owners can view and approve guest requests. Each request will have the email of the guest, the member who requested it, the role that was requested, and the name of the page.A workspace owner can approve or reject a request to invite a guest directly from the notification they receive, or by going to by going to Settings → Members → Guests and finding the requests at the top. Once a workspace owner responds to a request, the member who submitted will be notified of the decision.Change guest access levelsOnce you've added a guest to a page, you can always change their level of access later. To change a guest's access level:Go to Share at the top right. You'll see the page's guests listed in the dropdown menu.Click the menu to the right of a guest's name. Choose which level of access you want to grant that guest from the following options:Full access: They can edit and share the page.Can edit: They can edit the page's content, but they can't share the page. (This is not available for guests on the Free Plan.)Can edit content: This permission level is only found on database pages. They can create and edit pages within the database. They can't change the structure of the database and its properties, views, sorts or filters. Learn more about databases here →Can comment: They can only read and comment, not edit or share.Can view: They can only view the content, and can't share it.Remove: Revokes their access to the page.

Click to see or hop to the pages they can access.On any of these pages, you can edit their level of access or remove them.Turn guests into membersGive any guest the ability to access your entire workspace by turning them into a member. On paid plans, you'll be charged for each additional member. To turn a guest into a member:Go to Settings → People or Members (depending on your plan) → Guests.Check the box next to the guests you want to upgrade.Select Upgrade {#} guest(s) to member.Once they become a member, you can find them in your member list and change their role.On non-Enterprise Plans, we’ll also suggest some guests who might benefit from becoming members in your workspace. To see who these guests are, go to Settings → Members → Suggestions. You can select Upgrade to turn someone into a workspace member.Remove guestsTo remove a guest from your workspace:Go to Settings → People or Members (depending on your plan) → Guests.Check the box next to the guests you want to remove from your workspace.Select Remove from workspace.To remove a guest from specific pages, you’ll have to go to the Share menu in each page and Remove them there. GroupsYou can set varying and granular permissions for different groups and teams without having to divide your people into different workspaces! Instead, create groups inside one workspace and grant them different levels of access page by page. Here's how.Note: Guests in your workspace can't be added to groups. This feature is for members only! Create and edit groupsWorkspace owners and membership admins can create and edit groups. To do this:Go to Settings → People or Members (depending on your plan) → Groups.Select Create a group and enter a name for your group. To set an icon for the group, just click the emoji icon that appears on hover.Toggle open your new group and select Add members.Add as many members as you want to any group.You can also click Remove to the right of any group member.Select ••• next to a group to Rename it, Create teamspace from group, or Delete it.You can always search someone's name or email to see which group they're in. Share a page with groupsFor any page, choose which groups can read, comment, edit, and share it. To share a page with a group:Click Share, then Invite. You'll see all groups at the bottom of the pop-up.Pick a group, then choose what type of access you'd like to give that group from the dropdown:Full access: They can edit and share the page.Can edit: They can edit the page's content, but they can't share the page. (This is only available on paid plans.)Can comment: They can only read and comment, not edit or share.Can view: They can only read the content, and can't share it.Remove: Revokes their access to the page.Once a group has been added, you'll see it in the Share menu, and you can adjust their access level in the drop-down.You can give multiple groups access at any level on the same page.Permissions on any page also apply to all of their sub-pages.Share a teamspace with groupsTeamspaces are a dedicated area for every team within your organization or company, and can be customized on an individual basis. Learn more about teamspaces →To share a teamspace with groups in your workspace:Hover over the name of the teamspace in your sidebar.Click the ••• button, then Teamspace settings.From here, you'll be able to search and add groups to the teamspace.FAQsIs there a limit to how many guests I can add?See the guest limit for your plan here →If your workspace is above the guest limit for your plan, new users that you share content with can only be added as a member (instead of as a guest) if they belong to your workspace's email domains. This could mean that they have an allowed email domain or an email domain matching the workspace owner’s domain or one of the workspace’s verified domains.I clicked the Join or create workspace button, but it will only let me create a workspace. How do I join a workspace?You can only join a workspace via the Join or create workspace button if that workspace has the Allowed Email Domains setting enabled to allow users with your email domain join the workspace automatically.Otherwise, you'll need to ask an admin from the workspace to send you an invite.Why do I need to disable workspace-level access?You don't have to. Just know that whatever level of access is specified for Everyone at [workspace] is the lowest level of access for everyone in your workspace. If you want some pages to not be visible to certain people, then we recommend disabling it. You can always grant some groups or individuals more access.How can groups be used instead of multiple separate workspaces?We've seen people create multiple workspaces instead of groups to set granular permissions. For instance, they create separate workspaces for Design, Marketing, and their executive team so these groups can't access, edit, or get distracted by each other's work. There's a quick workaround for this using groups:Disable Workspace access. That way pages won't show for people and groups who aren't specifically granted access.On every page, grant different levels of access per group. Those access levels will hold true for all the sub-pages on that page.So, for example, you could have a section of your workspace just for the engineering team. Create a group of all your engineers, then on the top-level page for that team, turn on Full access for only that group. Nest pages inside that page, and only the engineering team can access them, too!Can I create a shared private page using groups?Yes. If you create a page in the Private section of your sidebar, you can go to Share and toggle on access for a group inside your workspace. Choose their access level like you would on any other page. You'll see the page automatically move to the Shared section of your sidebar. Only you and the members of that group will be able to see it.How can I allow members in my workspace to request guests for approval?As a workspace owner, you can disable guests for your workspace in your workspace security settings, but still allow members to send guest invite requests for review by the workspace owners. This provides a standardized way for guests to get access to content within your workspace, without being an all or nothing approach.Still have more questions? Message support"

Database commentsDatabase page commentsThere are a few ways to leave a top-level comment on a database page:Open the page and add a top-level page comment there.If the page already has comments, you’ll see 💬 associated with it in your database. Select 💬 to read the existing comments, then add your own. You’ll also be able to do the same from the Suggested for you and Trending widgets in Home. In a timeline view, you’ll only be able to do this if you’re showing a table next to your timeline. To do this, select >> at the left of your timeline. In a table or list view, hover over a database page and select ⋮⋮ → Comment to add a comment.In a gallery or board view, hover over a database page and select ••• → Comment to add a comment.In any database view except the timeline view, right-click on a database page and in the menu that appears, select Comment.

In most cases, you can do this by simply hovering over a property and selecting 💬. Learn more about commenting on database properties here →MentionsMention a person or groupWhen you want to get other people in your workspace to look at something, you can mention them anywhere inside a page, database, comment, or discussion.Type @ followed by the person or group's name. A pop up menu will search for them in real-time. Press enter to choose the one you want.Tip: You can hover over an @-mentioned group to get a preview of its members. The preview is limited to 10 members, so if you'd like a complete list: Go to Settings in your sidebar → Members.Select Groups at the top and you'll find a list of groups. Click the dropdown of any group to see a complete list of members.  To mention someone in a database, either @-mention them in the body of a page inside the database, or add them to a Person property field. They'll receive the same type of notification. This is handy for assigning people things in a tasks database. Mention a pageTo reference and add an inline link to another page inside a Notion page, type @ followed by the page's title. You'll see a menu pop up that'll search for that page in real-time. Find the right one and press enter. Now you and others can jump to the linked page directly.If you change the title of a page, the @-mention links that go to it will also reflect that change automatically. Tip: Whenever you @-mention a page, a backlink is created automatically! Learn more about backlinks → Mention a dateWhen you type @ followed by a date (or the words today, tomorrow, or yesterday), you'll add an inline timestamp to your page. For example, typing @1/12 automatically adds a timestamp that looks like: January 12, 2021.  Note: The words today, tomorrow, and yesterday turn into their corresponding numbered dates as time passes. Mention notificationsWhen someone mentions you in a workspace, you'll see a red badge appear next to Inbox in your sidebar with the number of notifications waiting for you.Open Inbox to see all the times you've been mentioned organized chronologically.You may also see mobile or desktop push notification depending on the apps you have installed and open.Click on any of these mention updates to jump directly to the line, comment, discussion or database you've been mentioned in on the page.Note: If you @-mention someone on a page that they don't have access to (like one of your private pages), they will not be notified. If you were mentioned in a comment, you can reply directly from your Inbox by clicking Reply.You can also resolve or re-open comments in this window. When you resolve a comment, it will disappear from the page it was made on. If you re-open a comment, it will reappear.RemindersWhen you add a reminder, Notion will send you a notification to draw your attention back to a particular task, event, or page at the time you specify. This is helpful for setting due dates and making sure you never forget a thing.Inline on a page, type @remind followed by a time, date, or both, i.e. @remind tomorrow, @remind 7pm, or @remind Wednesday at 1pm. This will create a blue tag. Clicking this tag opens up a calendar window where you can edit the date and time, change your timezone, and set exactly how you want to be reminded (i.e. 30 minutes beforehand).Inline reminders turn red when they change to @Today or are past due. In a database, add a Date property. When you click on that property (like on a cell in that column of a table), a calendar window opens where you can select when and how you want to be reminded. You can add a specific time of day as well. When you set a reminder, you'll be notified at the chosen time in a few ways:You'll see a red badge pop up next to Inbox at the top of your left sidebar.If you have the desktop Notion app, you'll receive a push notification immediately.If you have the mobile Notion app, you'll receive a push notification within 5 minutes.If Notion isn't open at the time of your reminder, you'll get a mobile push notification (if you have the app) and an email.FAQsSomeone @-mentioned me in a page, but I didn't receive an email notification.If you have Notion open on a mobile device or computer, you won't receive push or email notifications for reminders, you'll only get a red badge notification in All Updates.If Notion is not open on your mobile device or computer at the time of the notification, then you'll receive an email instead of a notification in All Updates.What's the difference between @-mentioning a page, and adding a Link to page block?Link to page works kind of like creating a sub-page. When you reference a Notion page this way, it will show up in your sidebar as a subpage of the page where it was linked.@-mentioning a page creates something more like a hyperlink. Pages you @-mention won’t show up as subpages of the pages they’ve been mentioned in.How can I trigger a reminder for someone else on my team?The best way to do this is to use an @-mention and @-remind on the same line. For example:""@Camille Ricketts @remind next Thursday 4pm to finish proofreading.""Does Notion have recurring reminders? Like ""remind me every Monday to water the plants""?Not at the moment, but recurring tasks and recurring reminders are on the roadmap!Still have more questions? Message support"
