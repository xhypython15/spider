BlockingHave a doctor‚Äôs appointment that you don‚Äôt want a teammate to schedule over? Notion Calendar‚Äôs blocking features make it easy to block events across your various calendars. For example, Notion Calendar can put a block on your work calendar for an event you have on your personal calendar, so people know you‚Äôre busy without being able to see your personal commitments.

Alternatively, you can select All events from {calendar name} to set up auto-blocking.

This will apply to future blocks if you choose to auto-block.If you manage your time across two calendars, like work and personal, use event blocking to automatically block time on each. To see what details you‚Äôve shared on a calendar block, right-click the original event and select Block on calendar. There will be a üîí¬†next to the calendar where the block was set up ‚Äî if the lock is open, that means the event‚Äôs details have been shared.

Then, you can find the block on your other calendar and see its details. Remove blockingYou can remove blocks the same way you created them. Right-click a blocked event and unselect the calendar where the block lives. You can unblock a single event, or turn off auto-blocking by unblocking all events.You may want to undo auto-blocking for a calendar that you no longer have access to.

Learn more here ‚Üí Conferencing integrationsFor the best experience with setting up conferencing integrations and adding conferencing links to events, use Notion Calendar on desktop or web. Notion Calendar integrates with conferencing tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and many more. There are three types of conferencing integrations in Notion Calendar:Default integrations: Conferencing that is available to you by default from your calendar provider. Google Meet, which is linked to Google Calendar, is one example.Connected integrations: An integration you can set up by logging into a conferencing tool. New events you create on desktop or web will generate new links for this conference tool from within Notion Calendar. Zoom is an example of a connected integration that Notion Calendar supports.Custom integrations: You can add a stable conferencing link for a conferencing tool of your choice by going to Settings ‚Üí Conferencing ‚Üí Conferencing providers ‚Üí Add. You can give your integration a name. This conferencing tool will show up in the conferencing dropdown when you create events. Any stable links will work, but Notion Calendar can detect popular services, including Around, BlueJeans, Doxy.me, Microsoft Teams, Skype, Webex, and Whereby.Note: If an event contains conferencing links in both its description and conferencing field, you‚Äôll be taken to the link from the event‚Äôs description when you join a meeting from Notion Calendar. Set a default conferencing optionA default conferencing option allows you to automatically add conferencing to an event that has at least one other participant when you‚Äôre using Notion Calendar on desktop. To set Zoom as this default option, go to Settings ‚Üí Conferencing ‚Üí Default conferencing, then in the dropdown, select Zoom.ZoomConnect your Zoom accountTo connect your Zoom and Notion Calendar accounts, go to Settings ‚Üí Conferencing.

When you‚Äôre redirected to your browser, make sure you‚Äôre logged in with the right Zoom account, then select Authorize to give Notion Calendar access.Notion Calendar asks only for the Zoom permissions that we absolutely need to make sure the integration with Notion Calendar works properly. These permissions are only used to allow you to connect your account and add Zoom meetings to events. Learn more about our security practices here ‚ÜíPasscode settingsIf you‚Äôve enabled the use of Personal Meeting IDs (PMIs) in your Zoom Profile Settings, Notion Calendar will use your configured stable PMI and passcode when adding a Zoom link to a meeting. If this setting is off in Zoom, Notion Calendar will protect your Zoom calls with a secure, one-time PIN and include it in the meeting for you and participants to join with a single click. Notion Calendar generates these PINs according to your Zoom admin's passcode complexity requirements.Disconnect your Zoom accountTo stop using your Zoom account with Notion Calendar, go to Settings ‚Üí Conferencing. Find Zoom and select Disconnect.If you remove Notion Calendar from your installed apps in Zoom App Marketplace, we will follow Zoom's deauthorization and data compliance guidelines.Note:If you‚Äôre having trouble authorizing Notion Calendar as you set up the integration, have an admin sign into marketplace.zoom.us, search for Notion Calendar, and turn on Pre-approve.Currently, when you join a meeting in the Zoom app from Notion Calendar, your video will be turned off by default.If you have any problems joining a meeting, try disconnecting then reconnecting your Zoom account. Google MeetBecause Notion Calendar is already connected to your Google account, you don‚Äôt need to do anything else to add Google Meet links to your meetings! Even if you‚Äôve connected multiple Google accounts to Notion Calendar, Notion Calendar will make sure you‚Äôre joining meetings across your various calendars from the right Google account.Note: If you don‚Äôt see Google Meet as a conferencing option in Notion Calendar, it might mean your Google Workspace doesn‚Äôt have Google Meet enabled.
