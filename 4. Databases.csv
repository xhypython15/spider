Intro to databases,"Intro to databasesPlayIn this ArticleDatabases in Notion are collections of pages. Here, we'll introduce you to the general structure of a database, walk you through the different menus and options, and deep dive into how to open and edit pages within a database. 🗃ContentsA tour of databasesCreate a databaseFull page vs. inline databasesDuplicate a databaseAdd and open database pagesItem optionsCustomize database pagesCollaborating in a database""Can edit content"" permission levelLock viewsThere are three things that make Notion databases unique:Every item is its own page: Every item you enter into your database is a Notion page. Open a database item to add more information in the form of text, images, and more, as you would with any other Notion page!You can customize properties: Add properties to contextualize, label, and augment any database item with things like dates, status, and links. Learn more about database properties here →You can toggle between multiple views: Your data isn't limited to a table. Visualize the information in a database as a list, calendar, chart, and more — whatever makes the information most useful. Learn more about views, filters, and sorts here →A tour of databasesEvery full page database has the same menus and sets of options. Here's a quick walkthrough. Views: Edit and switch between all the different views of your database. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view to see your other views.Add a new view: Add a new view to your database, with its own layout, filters and sorts. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and select Add view.Filter menu: Apply filters based on property values. When you apply a filter to a database, only you can see it to start, but you can save them to the view for your entire shared team if you prefer!Sort menu: Sort your data by a property. Like filters, sorts are only visible to you by default, but you can make them visible to your whole team as well.Database search: Type in any word, whether it's in the name of a database item or in a property, and your database will only show items that fit that search query.••• menu: Located at the top right of your database, this allows you to edit your view layout, grouping, properties, and more.Create a new database page: Click this to add a new page to your database. Depending on your screen size, this may appear as + or New. Open the dropdown next to this button to access and edit any database templates you've configured.Create a databasePlay To create a database in Notion, open a new or existing Notion page and type / followed by the type of database view you’d like to start with, like table or board. When you create a database, you can start from scratch or pull in data from another part of your workspace.If you want to use the same properties or an existing view of a database, we suggest selecting an existing data source. Search for an existing database and then choose the one you'd like to use.If the information you're adding to the database doesn’t exist anywhere else in your workspace, we suggest creating a new data source.Full page vs. inline databasesPlay Full page databasesFull page databases appear just like any other page in your sidebar.You can lock a full page database so that other people can't change properties and value options by selecting ••• at the top of your database → Lock database.To turn a full page database into an inline database, drag the database into another page in the sidebar, which will turn it into a subpage. Then navigate into the page, and select ⋮⋮ → Turn into inline.Inline databasesControls and menus for your inline database are hidden until you hover over it.You can expand an inline database to a full page database by selecting ⤡ at the top.You can turn an inline database into a full page database by clicking ⋮⋮ and dragging it into the sidebar as a top-level page.You can Delete, Duplicate, move, or copy the link to your inline database by selecting ⋮⋮, which will appear on hover to the side.In your sidebar, your inline database will appear as a subpage of the page it's in.Duplicate a databaseYou can make a copy of a database. For inline databases:Hover over the database, then select ⋮⋮.Select Duplicate. You can choose to Duplicate with content or, if you want to use the same database setup to organize other pages, Duplicate without content.For full pages:Click the ••• button in the top right.Select Duplicate. You can choose to Duplicate with content or, if you want to use the same database setup to organize other pages, Duplicate without content.Add and open database pagesEvery item in your database, whether it's a row in a table or a card on a board or calendar, is its own Notion page that you can build, format, and nest content in like any other page.To add database items:For all databases: Click the blue New button at the top right.For a table, list or board: Click + New at the bottom to add a new item.For a calendar: Click the + icon that appears when you hover over any day. This creates a new event on that day.For a gallery: Click the + New button in the empty card at the bottom of your gallery to add a new image frame right there.To open database items as pages:In tables, hover over your first column and click the OPEN button that appears.In lists, just click on the title of the item.In boards, calendars, and galleries, click anywhere on the card.Pages will always open in a peek preview. Click ⤡ at the top left to view in full page mode. In this page, you'll see all your database properties at the top. Each row is one property, with a name, type, and a value. Click on the value to edit.Click the ⋮⋮ that appears to the left of each property on hover in order to: drag it up or down, change the Property type, rename it, Duplicate or Delete it.Underneath your properties is free page space, where you can add any type of content block, including sub-pages or an inline database.Because database items are pages, any other type of content you drag into a database (like bullets or to-do items), will automatically turn into pages.Item optionsRight click on an item to reveal a list of actions. Those actions include:Delete: Deletes the item from your database.Duplicate: Creates an exact copy of the item.Copy link: Copies an anchor link to that specific item to your clipboard.Rename: Lets you rename the page in your row without opening it.Move to: Lets you move the row to another workspace or page (where it will show up as a subpage).Edit property: Brings up a menu with all your table's properties. Click the one you want and then click the new value for it.Customize database pagesThe top section of any page in a Notion database can include several things: Properties provide data about the page you're looking at, like project owner, due date, tags, and more.Comments capture conversation between you and your teammates. You can use them to tag each other, ask questions, provide feedback and more. Backlinks indicate all the pages that link to the current page so you can easily navigate between them.As with everything in Notion, you can customize the look and feel of these components. To access these options:Click the ••• at the top right of any Notion page in a database and select Customize page. For properties, you can use this menu to choose which property fields you want to show at the top of the page, and how. For each one, select from:Always show: Nothing changes, you continue to see the property field.Hide when empty:  The property field will disappear from the top of your page if it has no value in it.Always hide: The property field will not show up at the top of your page.You can also access the Customize page menu by clicking the ⋮⋮ icon next to any property in the list at the top of your database page. This ⋮⋮ icon can also be clicked and dragged up or down to reorder how properties are displayed on your page. Tip: If you have a database with dozens of properties, hiding some properties is a great way to keep your pages clear. Note: When you hide properties, they get aggregated in a single menu item at the bottom of the list. You can click this to easily show any hidden properties. For backlinks, you can choose:Expanded: See all the pages that link to the current page listed in full.Show in popover: In case you don't want to see all the pages, you can choose to see just the number of backlinks. Click to open a popup displaying all the pages.Off:  Just hide all backlinks entirely. For comments, you can choose to show them:Expanded:  Show the full conversation at the top of the page.Off: Hide comments on the page for a minimalist view. Collaborating in a databaseWhen using a database in a shared workspace, Notion has features in place to prevent accidental edits that could impact other teammates.""Can edit content"" permission levelClick Share at the top of a database to see and manage all users' permission levels. Learn more about sharing and permissions here →The Can edit content permission level is only found on database pages, and allows users to:Create, edit, and delete pages within the database.Edit property values for those pages.Users with Can edit content permissions in a database will not be able to:Add, edit, or remove database properties or views.Change filters or sorts.Lock or unlock the database. Note: Users with Can edit content access will still be able to create linked databases and edit views, sorts, and filters in that linked database. Learn more about linked databases → Lock viewsFind this option in the ••• menu at the very top right of the Notion window. Switch it on to prevent anyone from changing properties and views in your database. They'll still be able to edit the data it contains. Note that anyone with editing access can toggle this lock on or off at any time. This is helpful as a quick safeguard against accidental edits in a database that you'd like many people to be able to change structurally.

"Views, filters & sorts","Views, filters & sortsPlayIn this ArticleYou can view the same database in multiple ways, and switch back and forth between them depending on your needs. Within a view, you can add filters and sorts to easily categorize your content 📁ContentsTypes of database viewsCreate and switch between viewsCustomize your database viewsLink to your database viewOpen pages asFiltersAdd a filterAdd an advanced filterSortsGroupsSearch your databaseFreeze columnTypes of database views There are six different ways to visualize your content within a database. Here's a high level overview of each layout:Table: Tables allow you to see your database pages as rows, with every property represented by a column.Board: This view groups your items by property. For example, you could use it as a Kanban board to move tasks from one status to another as you make progress on them.Timeline: Use your database to plot project milestones on a timeline so you can see when they’re happening and how long they’ll take to complete.Calendar: Calendar view displays your items based on their Date property.List: Lists are a very clean, minimal layout of your database items.Gallery: This view is useful for highlighting images. You can edit your gallery to show images contained in the Files & media property — otherwise, the gallery will show any content that the database page contains.Chart: This view visualizes your database items in a bar, line, or donut chart so you can easily analyze and report on the data.Create and switch between viewsWhen you first create a database, you'll need to choose the layout of the default view. After this, you can create a new view by selecting + next to your existing views. Depending on your screen size, you may have to open the dropdown next to your current view and select Add view.You can also provide others with information by giving your view a description. To do this:Select a view → Edit view. Select ⓘ next to your view’s name, then enter your description. When you hover over a view, you will see its description. You can reorder your views by dragging them. If you have a lot of views, you can select {#} more... next to your views to do this. In your sidebar, views show up as nested items inside any full page database. You can tell they are views because they'll have a • to their left. Click on any view in your sidebar to jump right to it.Customize your database viewsWhen you’re in a given view, click its name to rename, duplicate, delete, copy its link, or edit its components. You can also edit view components by clicking the ••• at the top right of the database.Each view of the database has several components that you can customize:Layout: Choose how you want your database to be visually organized.Properties: Show or hide database properties for each view.Filters: Add criteria based on property values to show or hide data.Sorts: Sort by a property to change the order that pages are displayed in.Groups: Group your data by the values in a property.Link to your database viewYou can copy an anchor link to this specific view of your database so you can share it elsewhere.Click the ••• icon at the top right of your table.Click Copy link to {view} and the URL will copy to your clipboard so you can paste it.Open pages asWithin each view, you can choose how you'd like database pages to open. There are three options:Side peek: Open pages on the right side of the database. The rest of the database view continues to be interactive on the left.Center peek: Open pages in a focused, center modal.Full page: Open pages as full pages directly. To change the setting per view, click the ••• at the top right of your database, and open the Layout menu.Scroll down and change the Open pages in setting.Note: Table, Board, List & Timeline layouts will open pages in side peek by default. Gallery & Calendar layouts will open pages in center peek by default. FiltersNotion makes it easy to filter your database so it only displays the items that meet specified criteria, i.e. have (or don't have) certain properties. These filters can be as simple or complex as you like!Add a filterTo filter the entries you see in a database view:Click Filter at the top of your database.In the dropdown that appears, choose the property you'd like to filter by.This filter will now show up at the top of your database. Click the filter icon to see and edit all of the filters that have been applied to your database.Add another filter by clicking the filter icon. You can have as many filters as you'd like!Note: In a shared database, any changes you make to filters and sorts in views won’t affect other people on the team until you click Save for everyone. Add an advanced filterPlay You can create more specific database views and combine AND and OR logic by using filter groups. These can be nested up to three layers deep! Here's how:Click the filter icon at the top of your database → Add advanced filter.A new menu will pop up. Here, you can choose the properties that you'd like to filter by, and customize the AND and OR logic of the advanced filter.In the example below, we're filtering the table view of our Roadmap so that all the entries have to meet the criteria that include both AND and OR logic. Tip: You can quickly turn a filter into a filter group by clicking the ••• to the right of the filter, and selecting Add to advanced filter. SortsYou can sort your database so that items are displayed based on properties appearing in ascending or descending order.For example, you can order them based on priority, or last edited, or alphabetically.Click ⇅ at the top of your database.In the dropdown that appears, choose the property you'd like to sort by.This sort will now show up at the top of your database. Click to edit it.You can add as many sorts as you want, or remove them by clicking the X to their right.Change the order that multiple sorts are applied by dragging them up or down using ⋮⋮. Note: Different properties sort by different logic, depending on their value type.Text properties such as Name and Text sort alphabetically.Number properties sort numerically.For Select and Multi-select properties, you get to define what sorting order means. Click on the property, then drag options up or down to set the sort order. GroupsYou can group your database by different properties on your table to visualize them in different ways.Click the ••• menu and find Group. You can group by nearly any property type.The database will now group by values of that property. Each group includes a 👁️ to the left, so you can quickly hide groups and focus on what you need.You can sort your database groups by selecting Sort and choosing to sort manually or sort by the options provided (alphabetical, ascending, and more).Empty groups can also be hidden from view with the Hide empty groups toggle.Search your databaseYou can search for specific content in your database.Click 🔎 at the top right and type the word(s) you're looking for in page titles or properties.You'll see your database change in real-time to only show the items that fit that criteria.Freeze columnIf you have a large database, it's probably tedious to keep moving back and forth between properties to compare their data.  Instead you can freeze one column, which will cause it to stay visible on the left side no matter where you scroll in the database.To freeze a column, click the name of the column and click Freeze up to column.To unfreeze a column, click the name of the column and click Unfreeze column."

Learn more here → Database buttonsDatabase buttons automate your workflows so you don’t have to spend as much time manually updating your database. For example, you could use a button to approve a document or mark a daily habit as complete. Buttons can be added to your database as a property, and when a button is clicked, it’ll take actions on database pages so you don’t have to.To add a database button property:Select ••• at the top right of your database → Properties → New property → Button.Add a label for your button, like Approve or Complete.Add an action for your button. This is the action you want to have taken when the button is selected. Multiple actions can be taken using one button. You can select from:Add page to...: This will add a page to a database of your choice.Edit pages in...: This will edit properties for pages in a database of your choice.Show confirmation: This will show a message to the person who has selected the button before any further action is taken. You could pair this with another action so that you can be more careful with edits made to your database.Open page: This will open a page from a database of your choice. You can also decide how the page will open on the screen.Send Slack notification to...: This will send a Slack notification to the Slack channel of your choosing.Want more real-life examples of how to use database buttons? Read this guide → Manage propertiesTo manage the properties of a database, select ••• at its top right → Properties. From there, you can:Add a new property: Select New property, then select a property type and give your property a name.Hide a property: Select the eye icon next to a property you don’t want to show in your database.Edit a property: Select ⋮⋮. You can rename your property, hide it from view, wrap or don’t wrap it in view, duplicate it, or delete it.Rearrange properties: Drag ⋮⋮ to put your properties in a different order.Edit property valuesAny data put into a property is called a value. The way you edit values is different for each type of property. Here are just a few examples:For Select and Multi-select properties, you'll be prompted to add tags by typing what you want and pressing enter after each. Colors are randomly assigned.You can add as many unique tags to these menus as you want.Edit tag names and colors, or delete them by clicking on the property field (i.e. the table cell), then ••• that appears to the right when you hover over any property.Reorder tags by grabbing the ⋮⋮ icon to their left and dragging.For Date properties, clicking to add data will bring up our date picker, where you can select the day relevant to the database item — maybe it's an event date or deadline.Click Remind to set a reminder in this property that will notify you on the given date and time.Switch on End date to define a range of dates in this property.Switch on Include time to choose an exact time, not just a day.Click Date format & timezone to modify these settings.Click Clear to remove any value in the date property.For Files & media properties, clicking on the field provided will prompt you to upload a file, or paste a link to embed a file.You can also drag a file from your computer into the property to upload it.You can add multiple files into any field at once.Click on the ••• to the right of uploaded files to Delete, Download, Full screen or View original.Use the ⋮⋮ to the left of uploaded files to drag and re-order them.In a Person property, you can tag other members or guests in your workspace.Just type their names and press enter after each.To delete anyone tagged, click on them, then click X next to their name.Values automatically appear for these properties: Created time, Created by, Last edited time, Last edited By.You can simply type or paste values for URL, Email, Phone and Number properties, just like you would for a Text property.Editing values for Relation and Rollup properties requires multiple steps.Comment in propertiesYou can leave comments in database properties, only when you’re in table view or when you have a database page open.Note:At this time, you can’t comment in name, formula, rollup, button, and unique ID properties.Properties must already have a value assigned before someone can comment on them. To comment on a property while in table view:Hover over a property for a database item.Select the 💬 that appears.Enter your comment.Note: While you can comment on a checkbox property, you’ll have to open the database page to do so — there won’t be a way to do this from table view. To comment on a property while in a database page:Hover over a property.Select the 💬 that appears, or select the ⋮⋮ to the left of the property → Comment.Enter your comment.Once a comment has been made, you’ll see 💬 next to the property it’s attached to. You can select 💬 to see the comment and add to the conversation."
Relations & rollups,"Relations & rollupsPlayIn this ArticleHave you ever wanted to connect the data between two tables? You're in luck! Notion's relation property is designed to help you express useful relationships between items in different databases 🛠Jump to FAQsContentsWhat is a database relation?Example use casesCreate a relationTwo-way relationsView and remove related pagesDisplay options for relationsCustomize displayed properties for relationsRelate a database to itselfRollupsRollup typesAggregate rollupsWhat is a database relation?Let's say you have two databases for your theoretical business 😉One that tracks customersOne that tracks items purchasedYou want to know both which customers bought which items, as well as which items were purchased by which customers. This is a job for relations! In the two tables above, the columns labeled ↗ Items Purchased and ↗ Customers are relation properties, which can be added like any other database property.Here, when you add an item bought into the Customers database, the customers who bought them automatically appear in the ↗ Customers column in the Items database.Example use casesConnect your database of restaurants with your database of neighborhoods so you can see which restaurants are in which neighborhoods at a glance.Connect your database of meeting notes with your database of clients to provide quick access to the notes relevant to each client.Connect your database of tasks with your database of bigger projects to understand how projects are broken down into tasks, and how tasks contribute to projects.Connect your database of candidates with your database of interviewers to keep track of who interviewed whom.Create a relationTo relate two databases, you need two databases. So let's assume you've made the Customers and Items databases above for the purpose of this walkthrough.Add a new column/property to your Customers database and give it a name, like Items Purchased.Search for Relation.Then, search for the database you want to create the relation with. You'll see a preview of the relation. In this case, we've created a relation from the Customer database to the Items database.Click the blue Add relation button to finalize the creation of the new relation property. Now when you click in a cell in this relation column, you'll bring up a menu where you can search for and choose items from the other database to add.For example, this is how you can add which clothes each customer bought.To add an item, click the name in the list. To delete an item, hover over and then click the – button on the right. Tip: To change the database you're connecting to, re-select Relation as the property type for that particularly property. You'll be prompted to choose a new database. Two-way relationsRelations are created as one-way by default. But you can easily toggle on a corresponding relation in the destination database.With two-way relations, the edits work both ways! So if you add a customer to the Items database in the relation column, the change pops up in your Customers database.Follow the above instructions to create a new relation property.Click the toggle that says Show on [name of related database]. In our example, this says Show on Items DB.Give this corresponding relation a name.Below, you'll see a preview of the two-way relation. In this case, we've created a relation from the Customer database to the Items database, and a relation from the Items database to the Customer database.Click the blue Add relation button to finalize the creation of these two new relation properties. View and remove related pagesWhen you create a relation, you're essentially adding Notion pages stored in one database into the property field of another. These pages can be opened and edited like any other! Click on the page in the relation column. Then click on it again in the window that pops up.You can also remove any related page by hovering over and clicking the – at the right. You can choose to limit the number of pages that can be included in your relations property – with the option to select 1 page or to have No limit.If you select the option to limit it to 1 page, people using your database will only be able to select 1 page in the relation. This is especially useful for situations where only one page should be related to one another, for example - if only one order number should be associated with each purchase.Display options for relationsRelations can be displayed on pages in three different ways. To change the display:While on a database page, click on the relation. Click Show as and select one of the following:As property: The relation will be displayed at the top of the page, alongside all the page properties.As page section: The relation will be displayed right above the page body, as its own section. Best option if you want the relation to standout. Minimal: The relation will be display right above the page body, but with the content hidden. Note: If you want to change a relation from Minimal to another display, click ••• -> Customize page. Customize displayed properties for relationsWhen you set up a relation in your database, you can also choose to display certain properties of linked pages. For example, let’s say you have a database of frequently asked questions at your company. Each FAQ has a relation to a page that further explains the answer to the question. You might want people to also be able to see the owner of each page, so they know who to reach out to with more questions. You can set your FAQ database up so that the owner is visible along with the relevant page!To do this:Open a page in a database that has a relation property.Click the field next to that property to link a page → click •••.In the menu that appears, drag the properties of the related database into or out of Shown in relation or Hidden in relation.Once you’re done, you’ll see your desired properties appear in the relation field. This will apply to all of the pages in your current database. Relate a database to itselfLet's say you want items in the same database to have relationships with each other. For example, you have a tasks database and you want each task to relate to other tasks.Start off by creating a new relation. Then search for and choose the database you're currently working in.You'll now see that the database is related to This database. Just as with relations between two databases, you can choose to make this a one-way relation or two-way relation.To make it a two-way relation, toggle on Separate properties. You'll see a second property show up.RollupsRollups help you aggregate data in your databases based on relations. Going back to our customers and items example above, let's say you wanted to know how much each customer spent based on what they bought.First, create the relation so you know who bought what.Add a new column/property and choose Rollup from the Property type menu. Give it a descriptive name. Clicking on any cell in the rollup column will bring up a new menu asking you for:The relation property you want to roll up.The property of those related pages you want to roll up.The calculation you want to apply to them.So, for our example, you'd choose to roll up the relation property Items Purchased and the Price property within those pages. Then you'd choose Sum as the calculation.Doing this adds up the prices of each item related to a customer's name, giving you the total dollars they spent in your rollup column. Rollup typesThere are different calculations you can apply as a rollup. Here are all of them:Show original: This just shows all related pages in the same cell. It's the same as the relation property itself.Show unique values: This shows each unique value in the selected property for all related pages.Count all: Counts the total number of values in the selected property for all related pages.Count values: Counts the number of non-empty values in the selected property for all related pages.Count unique values: Counts the number of unique values in the selected property for all related pages.Count empty: Counts the number of related pages with an empty value for the property selected. So, if one item a customer bought didn't have a price and that was the property selected, the rollup column would say 1.Count not empty: Counts the number of related pages with assigned values for the property you selected.Percent empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with no value in the property you selected.Percent not empty: Shows the percentage of related pages with a value in the property you selected.These rollup calculations are only available for Number properties:Sum: Computes the sum of the numeric properties for related pages (like above).Average: Computes the average of the numeric properties for related pages.Median: Finds the median of the numeric properties for related pages.Min: Finds the lowest number in the numeric property for related pages.Max: Finds the highest number in the numeric property for related pages.Range: Computes the range between the highest and lowest numbers in the numeric property for related pages (Max - Min).These rollup calculations are only available for Date properties:Earliest date: Finds the earliest date/time in the date property for all related pages.Latest date: Finds the latest date/time in the date property for all related pages.Date range: Computes the span of time between the latest and earliest dates in the date property for related pages.Aggregate rollupsIn both tables and boards, you can apply calculations to your rollup column to get a sense of sums, ranges, averages, etc. for your entire database.Let's say you want to find the total money spent by all customers in our example.At the bottom of your Customers table, under your rollup column, click Calculate.Choose Sum to add all the values in that column together and get a grand total. FAQsCan I export or import relations?When you export a relational database as a CSV file, the relation properties will export as plain text URLs. For now, you can't re-import that CSV back into Notion to re-establish the relations with other databases.Can I duplicate a database with a relation?Yes, but the following will happen which can be kind of confusing:If you create a copy of the Customers database in the example above, you'll see a new relation property automatically appear in the Items database.This happens because relations sync two ways in Notion. When a database is duplicated, you also duplicate its relationships with other databases. You'll get the hang of it! 💪Can I rollup a rollup?Unfortunately not, as this could create unintended loops. We recommend sticking to rolling up other properties 😊Still have more questions? Message support"

Database templates,"Database templatesPlayIn this ArticleMost databases contain the same types of pages created over and over again. Think of weekly meeting notes, bug reports, or design specs. To make this easy, database templates let you define and replicate certain page structures with one click 🖨Jump to FAQsContentsCreate a database templateUse a database templateRepeating database templatesCreate a repeating database templateNesting database templatesEdit, duplicate, or delete an existing templateCreate a database templateTo create a template inside a database, click the dropdown arrow next to New at the top right of your database. Then, select + New template. When editing a new or existing template, you'll see a bar across the top indicating which database it's located in. Whatever you title this page will be the name of the template you use going forward. For instance, you might title this one Bug.On this page, you can define properties for your template. For example, you can create a template for bug reports that automatically puts P1 in the Priority property and assigns the user Fig to the Product Manager property. You can also add content in the page itself. Templates can contain any type of content, including images, embeds, and sub-pages. Whatever you choose will show up identically on each page created with the template.Note: If you add a relation property to a template, do not fill it in unless you want every page you create with that template to relate to the same existing page(s). Use a database templateCreate a new page in your database and choose any of the templates from the gray menu it contains.You can also click the dropdown menu on the right of the blue New button at the top right of your database.

Database automations,"Database automationsPlayIn this ArticleImprove your efficiency by automating the most tedious parts of your work 🔁Jump to FAQsContentsCreate a database automationDatabase automation triggersDatabase automation actionsEdit, pause, or delete database automationsDatabase automations are sequences of actions that happen any time a specific change to a database occurs. Automations consist of both triggers (the events that initiate the automation) and actions (the effect of the automation). Database automations are meant to help save you time and simplify your work, and can be very basic or more complex depending on your needs.Database automations can be used for many things, including:Assigning a task to a specific person when its status changes.Sending a Slack notification to a channel when a page is added to a database.Note:Database automations are available on paid plans on all platforms. Free plan users can create Slack notification automations and use, but not edit, existing automations in templates.Database automations can be created, edited, or deleted by anyone with full access to the database. Slack automations are the only exception. These can only be edited by the automation creator.Automations won’t take action on any pages whose access is restricted. You can check and change page access in the share menu.Database automations can't be triggered by other automations. Button actions, however, can trigger database automations. For example:A recurring template automation will not trigger a database automation.A database automation creating a page in another database will not trigger a database automation.A user clicking a button that creates a page will trigger a database automation. Create a database automationTo create a database automation:Click ⚡ at the top of a database → New automation.Give your database automation a name if you’d like.Add triggers. Learn more about the types of triggers below →Add actions. Learn more about the types of actions below →Select Save.Did you know you can also add a button property to your database? With the click of a button, actions can be taken on your database on your behalf. Learn more here → Database automation triggersAutomations can have one trigger or multiple triggers. When you set up an automation, you can decide whether the automation will take place When any of these occur or When all of these occur.Note: If you have multiple is edited triggers that must all occur for your automation to take place, those triggers need to happen within a small window of about three seconds. If they don’t, your automation may not be triggered properly. To avoid this, you can:Create separate automations for each trigger.Use a more specific trigger than is edited, like is set to or contains. You can choose from two types of triggers: Page added or Property edited.If you choose a Property edited trigger, you can indicate which properties from your database will trigger the automation.For name, person, number, text, select, and relation properties, you can choose what kinds of edits made to that property will trigger an automation. For example, you might have a list of contacts in a Notion database and set up an automation where the trigger is a phone number starting with the numbers 732, and the action is that person’s state being set to New Jersey.You can also have more than one condition for your trigger so that two or more things must be true for the automation to occur.Database automation actionsAutomations can take one action or multiple actions. You can choose from a variety of actions:Edit property will edit the properties of pages in the database you are currently in.Add page to will add a page to a database of your choosing, and edit the properties of that page.Edit pages in will edit pages and properties in a database of your choosing.Send notification to will send a notification to specific people in your Notion workspace. Your recipient can be up to 20 people in your workspace, or people who are associated with a certain People property in your database. Add a message that you want to go along with the notification.Send Slack notification to… will send a notification to the Slack channel you want.If you choose an Edit property trigger, you can indicate how you want those properties to be updated.For multi-select, people, and relation properties, you can add or remove individual values instead of adding or removing all values at once. For example, you might have a task database where if the task name contains the word “blog”, your name is added to the people property, even if there are other people already assigned to that task.Get more inspiration for using database workflows in this guide → Edit, pause, or delete database automationsTo see and manage all of the automations for a database:Click ⚡ at the top of a database.This ⚡ will only appear if you have active automations.Hover over the automation and click •••.Select Edit, Pause, or Delete.FAQsHow frequently is the database scanned for “changes” in properties?Database automations work over a three second window. For example, within this three second window, a user can remove a trigger and delete any changes, resulting in no property change to the automation.Do automations work on pages in the entire database, or pages in a single database view?Either one. During the creation process, you can specify if the automation should run on pages in the entire database, or in a specific view. If any filters in that view change, the automation will then apply to the adjusted list of pages.Can guests with full access to a database create automations?Unfortunately, guests can't create database automations.Still have more questions?

Intro to formulas,"Intro to formulasIn this ArticleIn a Notion database, you can add a formula property that lets you run all kinds of calculations and functions based on other properties. You can use formulas to manipulate existing data and arrive at many other helpful values 🔮ContentsAdding a formula propertyWriting a formulaFormula editorFormula data typesNotion formulas can perform calculations on your existing database properties and help give you better understanding of your data.For a comprehensive tutorial on formulas and how you might use them, check out these resources:Formula syntax & functions How to write Notion formulas that extend the capabilities of your databases Adding a formula propertyTo start writing a formula, add a formula property to your Notion database:Click the ••• menu on your databaseSelect Properties and click + Add a propertySelect FormulaClick Edit and begin writing your formulaWriting a formulaFormulas 2.0We've recently updated our formula language! Your existing formulas will be automatically migrated for this update and should behave the same. For more information, check out our guide:How to use Notion’s new and improved formulas with your existing setups Notion’s formula syntax might look familiar if you’ve done any programming before! You’ll choose functions (which accomplish different tasks) and inputs (data to manipulate). An output (the result) will be computed and displayed in the new formula property for every row in your database.For example, in this formula: dateSubtract(prop(""Date""), 14, ""days"")The function is dateSubtract()dateSubtract() takes in a date, number, and then a unit text, which can be ""days"", ""hours"", etc.The inputs are Date (property), 14 (number), and ""days"" (unit of time).The output will be a date representing 14 days before your Date property Formula editorNotion’s formula editor contains several helper features to assist in writing formulas. The editor automatically provides suggestions of functions or properties based on what's in your formula.You can navigate this suggestions panel with up & down arrows and use Enter to accept a suggestion.Long formulas will wrap once you’ve exceeded the width of the editor, but you can also use Shift + Enter to create a new line!To navigate between lines, you can use alt/option + up/down.If you open the formula editor from a database row, you'll see a live preview of the result of the formula for that row.Note that the result preview will not display line breaks, which can be added using ""\n"" in the formula, e.g. ""Hello"" + ""\n"" + ""World""The editor will display errors and highlight the erroneous code, so you can better identify the source of issues.Formula data typesFormulas can manipulate and return different data types. Other property types are supported but their data type will be converted. TextFor example, ""Hello world""NumberFor example, 1, -2.5Can be displayed using the formatting options of the Formula property (e.g. as a percentage, currency, or with a ring or bar).DateDisplays as a date with time (like August 29, 2023 1:33 PM) and can be reformatted to text using the dateFormat() function.Dates can be date ranges, which can be constructed using the dateRange() function.Dates cannot store seconds or milliseconds.PeopleYou can use name() or email() to retrieve data off any People types.Displays as people’s names with their photos.Booleans Can be true or false.Displays as a filled or unfilled checkbox.PagesRepresents Notion pages, like relations.You can retrieve the properties of a given Notion page by using . on them!Displays as a rich page link with the page's icon.Lists (or arrays)Lists can hold items of any type, including more lists. Multi-select, People, Relation, and most Rollup properties will return list values.You can use list functions like at(), filter(), map() to manipulate lists.Use the includes() function to check whether these values contain a specific value instead of equality checks. Example: prop(""Tags"").includes(""Movie"")List items display comma-separated for texts, numbers, and dates. For people, checkboxes, and pages, they display space-separated.EmptyThe empty value is not displayed in the output of a formula property, but can be used in the computations themselves.You can check for emptyness on any piece of data with the empty() function.For example, toNumber("""") or parseDate(""Not a date"") will return Empty."

To do this:Open your database and select ••• at the top.Select Customize {your database's name}.Search for Sprints.Select Add next to Sprints.Select Turn on sprints.Sprint board and sprints databaseOnce you turn on sprints for your database, a few items will be created to help you track them. These will be accessible in your Notion sidebar, alongside the original database you used to set up sprints.The Sprint board is where you can track all of the tasks belonging to your current and future sprints, using a few different views:Current Sprint: Shows tasks in the current sprint.Sprint planning: Shows tasks in the current, next, and last sprint, as well as any tasks not yet assigned to a sprint.Backlog: Shows tasks not assigned to a sprint. The Sprints database will give you a general view of your current and future sprints. You can open any sprint's page to view the tasks within. You'll also notice a Timeline view, which gives you a more linear look at your sprints.If you’ve accidentally deleted the Current Sprint view and want to recreate it:Set up a view in the original task database that you’d like to use as your Current Sprint view.Select ••• at the top right → Customize {your database's name} → Sprints → Manage sprint from this view.

You can move them to the next sprint, move them to your backlog, or keep them in the current sprint.Select Complete Sprint.Alternatively, you can seamlessly transition from one sprint to the next by setting sprints to automatically complete. Learn about how to set your sprints to automatically complete and begin below → When you complete a sprint:The status of your Current sprint will be changed to Last. Whichever sprint was currently assigned to Last, if there is one, will now be set to Past.The status of the Next sprint will be changed to Current.The tasks on the board will reflect the new Current sprint.The Next sprint will be created if none exists.Sprint settingsCustomize your sprints to fit your needs. To do this, go to your sprint board and select ••• → Customize {your database's name} → Sprints. From here, you can adjust the following:Duration: Choose how many weeks (from one to eight) you want each sprint to run for.Start on: Choose which day of the week you want your sprints to begin on. If you change this in the middle of an active sprint, the current sprint’s dates will change. For example, if your sprints used to run for two weeks starting on Mondays, but you want your sprints to run for two weeks starting on Thursdays, your current sprint will run until two weeks after the upcoming Thursday, so that your next sprint can begin on Thursday as you indicated.Incomplete tasks: Choose what will happen to any incomplete tasks from your sprints. You can put them in the next sprint, move them to your backlog, or keep them in their original sprint.Automated sprints: Turn this on if you want sprints to complete automatically before the next one is automatically created and started.Turn off sprints: Choose this to turn off a sprint. Once you turn sprints off, your sprints database, sprint board, and relations between tasks and sprints will be permanently deleted. If you choose to turn sprints on again, you’ll start with a brand new database, board, and relations.Note:You can’t adjust the dates in your sprints database because these dates are either populated based on the settings above, or set when you manually complete a sprint.If you need to break your sprint cadence temporarily, like for the holidays, we suggest turning off automatic sprints and waiting until you’re ready to resume your normal sprint cadence before starting your next sprint.

We suggest selecting an existing data source if you want to use the same properties from another database, or an existing view living elsewhere in your workspace. Search for an existing database and then choose the one you'd like to use.We suggest creating a new data source if the information you're adding to the database is completely new and doesn’t exist anywhere else in your workspace, or if you want to keep it separate from other data. To create a new database, click New table, New list, etc. (depending on the type of view you are creating) in the menu that appears.Create a linked databaseThink of each linked database as a two-way excerpt of the source database.

Optimize database load times & performance,"Optimize database load times & performanceIn this ArticleHere’s how to make sure your databases are always feeling quick and snappy 🏃🏼ContentsThings that can slow your database downThings you can do to speed up your database setupAvoid building too many databases into high-traffic pagesAvoid complex reference chainsMinimize the number of filters and sorts on formulas and rollupsFilter on simple propertiesHide unnecessary propertiesDelete any unused pagesWe’re always working to improve your experience with Notion, and we appreciate your feedback and patience. If your databases aren’t feeling very fast when you use them, there are a few reasons why this might be happening, and a few ways you can make improvements.Things that can slow your database downNumber of pages: If your database has a ton of pages, it might be slower to load.Number of properties: The more visible properties your database has, the longer it might take to load.Complex sorts and filters: If your database has a sort or filter on properties like title, text, formula, or rollup, the logic behind it can make load times longer.Things you can do to speed up your database setupAvoid building too many databases into high-traffic pagesIf you have a large workspace, avoid having lots of inline databases, like dashboards, in high-traffic pages. The more simultaneously viewed databases, the more stress on your setup.Try housing each database in its own page first. Once you’ve done that, if you’d like all of the databases to be displayed in one page, you can:Type /linked in that page and select Linked view of a database to create a linked database.Create database views in this linked database and configure them to point to your desired source databases. Different database views can point to different source databases!When using a single linked database, only one database view is open at a time, and therefore only that one database is listening for updates. You should see an improvement in performance with this setup.Avoid complex reference chainsFormulas and rollups are extremely powerful, but the more complex they are, the slower your database may be. For example, a formula that depends on several other formulas that each depend on rollups may take longer to calculate.Minimize the number of filters and sorts on formulas and rollupsDatabases that are filtered and sorted on formula and rollup properties may take a bit longer to load.Filter on simple propertiesAdding filters based on simple properties such as select, multi-select, status, number, and date may improve the speed of your database. Even if you have complex filters, this may help by reducing the number of pages that need to be processed.Hide unnecessary propertiesIf some properties are less important in your database view, hiding them may improve responsiveness and interactivity.Delete any unused pagesWe suggest removing any unnecessary or duplicative pages from your database to keep it as simple and up-to-date as possible. If that’s not an option for you, adding a filter on the Created time property to filter out old pages may significantly improve performance for very large databases.Learn more about databases to make sure you're using them in the best way for your specific needsOrganize information with databasesMore resources on databases "

Certain formulas, like formulas based on relations and rollups and other complex formulas, may cause charts to take a little bit longer to load. The X and Y axes of your chart can be configured to show you what’s most important. To configure your X axis:With your chart view open, select ••• at the top of your database.Under X axis, you can adjust the following:What to show: Choose the property that should be associated with your X axis. Let’s say you want the X axis to show your tasks by status.Sort by: Choose how your data should be sorted. For example, you might want to sort by ascending status (going from to-do to complete). You can also control what’s shown or hidden from your chart by selecting 👁️ next to any of the options under Visible groups. For example, you might choose to exclude any tasks marked as complete from your chart if you’re only looking to visualize your in-progress tasks. Anything that’s hidden will move to Hidden groups.Omit zero values: Depending on your setup, you may or may not see this option. Toggle this on or off depending on whether you want to include property values for which there are no associated items. For example, let’s say you have a status for paused tasks. If there aren’t any tasks in your database that are paused, you can toggle Omit zero values off if you don’t want the paused status shown in your chart. If you toggle on Omit zero values, you’ll see all of the status options in your chart, even if there are no tasks for some of those status options.To configure your Y axis:With your chart view open, select ••• at the top of your database.Under Y axis, you can adjust the following:What to show: Choose the property that should be associated with your Y axis.

Toggle this on or off depending on whether you want to include property values for which there are no associated items. For example, let’s say you have a status for paused tasks. If there aren’t any tasks in your database that are paused, you can toggle Omit zero values off if you don’t want the paused status shown in your chart. If you toggle on Omit zero values, you’ll see all of the status options in your chart, even if there are no tasks for some of those status options.Cumulative: You’ll see this option if your chart is showing Count or Sum and your X axis property is sorted in ascending order. Toggle on Cumulative if you want your chart to reflect the total amount of information gathered over time. Toggle off Cumulative if you want the chart to reflect the data for the current moment in time. For example, let’s say you have a chart where you’re tracking how many tasks you have completed. You completed two tasks yesterday, and three tasks today. If Cumulative is toggled on, you’ll see two tasks completed yesterday, and five tasks (two from yesterday, three from today) completed today. If Cumulative is toggled off, you’ll see two tasks completed yesterday, and three tasks completed today.
